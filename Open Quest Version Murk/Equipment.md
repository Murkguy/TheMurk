# The Equipment Lists

Equipment lists make up the rest of this chapter. These lists provide the scarcity of the item and details any game effects. They also, where appropriate, give an Encumbrance value (ENC) for the item in question. Encumbrance is a value which rates both the weight and how physically unwieldy an object is. Encumbrance rules are given in The Quest chapter.

## Close Combat Weapons

All Close Combat weapons use the Close Combat skill. The following qualities characterise each close combat weapon:

- __Damage Dice:__ The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

- __Hands:__ The number of hands the weapon requires to use.

- __ENC:__ The weapon’s encumbrance a measure of its weight and bulk.

- __Scarcity:__ The difficulty in finding this item.

## Ranged Weapons

The following qualities characterise each ranged weapon:

- __Damage Dice:__ The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

- __Hands:__ The number of hands the weapon requires to use.

- __Range:__ This is the effective range of the weapon. Within the weapon’s range, the Attacker shoots without penalty. If the target is within double the weapon’s range, the attacker’s Ranged Combat skill is modified by -25%. Attacks cannot be made at a distance beyond twice/double the weapon’s range.

- __Rate:__ This shows how many missiles can be fired per Combat Rounds, taking into consideration the time to load the weapon. For example, 1 CR, means one missile every combat round, while 1/3 CR means one missile every three combat rounds.

- __ENC:__ The weapon’s encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the weapon.

- __Scarcity:__ The difficulty in finding this item.


### Using Ranged Weapons in Close Combat

Unless the weapon can be used in close combat, and has an entry in that table, a ranged weapon is treated as an improvised weapon, doing damage equal to its closest hand-to-hand equivalent if that is less than its ranged weapon damage.

The following qualities characterise a set of armour:

- __AP:__ The armour point value of the armour.

- __ENC:__ The armour’s encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the armour.

### Effects of SIZ on Armour

Armour made for a character of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its scarcity and ENC halved from that shown on the Armour table. Characters of SIZ 21 or higher will double the scarcity and ENC for armour made for them.

*Plate Armour: Characters may try using plate armour not designed for them, but at double ENC.*

*Layering Armour: Characters may not wear more than one type of armour, i.e. layer armour, to get increased Armour Points.*
