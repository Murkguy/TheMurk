# The Game | The Murk SRD

## Before We Start

Content Warning: [...]

Before you start, define lines that should not be crossed. Pause or rewind the game if something uncomfortable happens during a session. Always make sure everyone is comfortable with the direction of the story.

## Playing The Game

The Murk best operates like your favorite show or movie. One person will take the role of the "Director" and the rest of the people shall play "Actors"

**Director**: Frames the story, provides the scenery and conflict for your Actors to shine on. Is compelling and draws Actors in with great scenes, controls the table to drive the plot forward.

**Actor**: Narrates and acts on their character. Is compelling, and feeds on other Actors and the Director. Enables others to shine, and prepares for their moments with excitement.

## Rolling Philosophy

The system aims to provide mechanics that can address most inquiries, while ensuring that the system serves the purpose of storytelling rather than overpowering it. Therefore, many of our mechanics are intentionally designed to be straightforward, following a set of essential principles that foster enjoyable and seamless gameplay. Here are some guidelines that all play can be expected to follow.

**Roll for Consequences, not Results**

We assume that individuals are reasonably proficient in carrying out everyday tasks in normal circumstances. If you're a skilled marksman, it's expected that you can shoot a gun accurately at a firing range for leisure. Professional drivers don't need to roll dice to remember which pedal is the brake and which is the gas. In fact, in a typical life, there are rarely challenges to one's basic skills.

However, the characters in the Murk don't lead ordinary lives. While their skills are significant, what truly matters is the outcome of their failures. The Game Master (GM) should only request a dice roll if there are consequences tied to a potential failure. These consequences can range from minor setbacks to game-changing developments in the story. The ultimate goal is to advance a captivating narrative, and no gaming table wants to get caught up in skill checks that bear no impact on the story or its characters.

**Let it Ride**

In order to maintain a smooth and engaging gameplay experience, we avoid getting stuck in a cycle of repetitive skill checks. We don't want sessions to become weighed down by a series of sneak checks for every guard encountered, or multiple driving checks for each turn while evading adversaries. That's where the "Let it Ride" rule comes into play. According to this rule, there should be no need for repeated skill checks unless the situation undergoes a significant change. This means that, for a single scene, most skills will only be rolled once outside of combat, ensuring a more fluid and immersive storytelling experience.

**Embrace the Rule of Cool**

In The Murk, we value the concept of "cool" moments that can push the boundaries of the rules in a fun and exciting way. While the characters in the game may not possess immense power, allowing players to occasionally stretch the rules to create memorable and enjoyable experiences often leads to the most thrilling parts of a session. If something is fun and cool, we encourage you to let it play out, embracing the spirit of adventure and imagination that makes The Murk truly special.


# Units of Time in Game

In The Murk, time is not measured in traditional units or hours. Instead, we emphasize the exciting and engaging aspects of your characters' lives, skipping the mundane details of everyday existence. The goal is to create a gameplay experience that resembles a gripping novel or a well-paced TV show. To achieve this, we use the terms Epic, Story, Scene, and Moment to capture the essence of significant events without delving too deeply into timekeeping minutiae. This approach allows us to focus on the most compelling aspects of the game, keeping the momentum and immersion at its peak.

## Season

An Season refers to a grand narrative encompassing a collection of interconnected stories, all centered around the same characters, themes, and experiences. Within an Season, multiple Stories unfold, shaping both the world and the characters involved. Just like the legendary tales of Gilgamesh, Beowulf, and The Odyssey, an Season comprises numerous individual stories that come together to provide a comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the events and adventures within its realm.

## Episode

Within an Season, there are multiple Episodes, each comprising a complete plot with a beginning, middle, and end. These Episodes encapsulate various adventures and quests, such as storming a castle to rescue a noble, exploring haunted tunnels, or unraveling the secrets of a deceased Magister. Each Episode is further divided into Scenes, which contribute to the progressing plot within the group and throughout the world. At the conclusion of each Episode, the characters are given the opportunity to reflect on their experiences, contemplate life, and hopefully undergo personal growth.

## Scene

Scenes encompass the various settings and events that players encounter and navigate throughout the game. They can range from a battle in a narrow corridor, to attending the wedding of the mayor's son, to engaging in a conversation with your greatest adversary. Scenes can be diverse and multi-faceted, but they are typically categorized into different types:

- Combat scenes involve intense struggles where life or death hangs in the balance.

- Social scenes revolve around navigating specific situations, where your actions and words have the power to shape the world around you.

- Skill scenes require expertise and problem-solving, such as crafting a peculiar artifact or stealthily infiltrating an ancient manor.

- Paranormal scenes explore the effects of Esoteria and Faith, involving encounters with supernatural creatures and abilities.

- Reflection scenes provide an opportunity for the party to rest, regroup, and engage in internal discussions about their recent experiences.

It's important to note that very few scenes strictly adhere to a single type, and often blend and evolve as the scene progresses.

## Moment

A **Moment** is just what it sounds like, a brief split second in real life. It's the cut of a camera to a person talking, fighting, or doing any 1 action. Moments are used in all types of Scenes.
