## Character Concept

A character concept is a one-sentence summing up of what the character is all about.

### Step 1: Determine Concept and Homeland

In a couple sentence, sum up what your character is all about. Use the guidelines above to give yourself ideas. Ask the other actors what their character concepts are to make sure the group has an exciting selection of characters.

It's reccomended to that these storyions be answered, but feel free to add other information as well
    - What do people notice about you first?
    - What item do you always have on hand?
    - Where do you want to go?
    - Where would you never go again?
    - Does anyone miss you?
    - Is anyone looking for you?

Check with your Director that your character concept fits in with the type of game that the group is going to be playing.

#### Homelands
Read up on the available homelands and determine how their history and culture may have shaped who you are today.

### Characteristics

The characteristics are:

- Strength (STR): A character’s capability with brute force, strength affects the amount of damage they deal, how much they can lift and so on.

- Constitution (CON): A measure of the character’s health, constitution affects how much damage they can sustain in combat, as well as general resistance to disease and other illnesses.

- Dexterity (DEX): Dexterity is the character’s agility, coordination and speed of reactions. This ability aids a character in many physical actions, including combat.

- Size (SIZ): Size is an indication of the character’s mass and, like strength and constitution, affects the amount of damage a character can deal, and how well they can absorb damage.

- Intelligence (INT): A character’s ability to think around problems, analyse information and memorise instructions.

- Power (POW): Power is a measure of the character’s life force, the strength of their willpower, and a measure of how much magic power they have. It is a beneficial characteristic for those interested in becoming accomplished spellcasters.

- Charisma (CHA): This quantifies a character’s attractiveness and leadership qualities.

### Step 2: Generate Characteristics

Random Generation of Characteristics

If you prefer a more traditional method of rolling dice to create characteristics, follow this process.

For humans.

| Attribute | Dice  |
| --------- | ----- |
| STR       | 3d6   |
| DEX       | 3d6   |
| CON       | 3d6   |
| SIZ       | 2d6+6 |
| INT       | 2d6+6 |
| POW       | 3d6   |
| CHA       | 3d6   |


### Attributes

Attributes are a set of secondary scores that define the character’s potential to do and take physical damage, how quickly they move, and the amount of magical energy available to the character. The character’s characteristic scores determine the value of their attributes.

- __Damage/Health Modifier (DM):__ The Damage Modifier applies whenever the character uses a melee or thrown weapon. It’s calculated by adding the character’s Strength and Size together and referring to the table below. The modifier gets more significant when the sum of Strength and Size are higher –bigger, stronger, characters deal out more damage than smaller, weaker, characters.

Damage/Health Modifier

| Total of STR and SIZ | Damage Modifier |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1-10                 | -2d6 *          |
| 11-15                | -1d6 *          |
| 16-25                | +0              |
| 26-30                | +1d6            |
| 31-45                | +2d6            |
| 46-60                | +4d6            |
| Every addtional 15   | +2d6            |

- __Initiative Modifier (IM):__ The Initative Modifier applies whenever the character rolls for initative during or at the beginning of combat. It’s calculated by adding the character’s Dexterity and Intelligence together and referring to the table below. The modifier gets more significant when the sum of Dexterity and Intelligence are higher –sharper, faster, characters act sooner that slower, less intelligent ones.

Initative Modifier

| Total of DEX and INT | Initiative Modifier |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1-10                 | -2d6 *          |
| 11-15                | -1d6 *          |
| 16-25                | +0              |
| 26-30                | +1d6            |
| 31-45                | +2d6            |
| 46-60                | +4d6            |
| Every addtional 15   | +2d6            |

- __Social Modifier (SM):__ The Social Modifier applies whenever the character rolls to apply strain to another character during a social conflict. It’s calculated by adding the character’s Charisma and Power together and referring to the table below. The modifier gets more significant when the sum of Charisma and Powerful are higher –forceful, empowered, characters tend to bend others to their will more easily.

Social Modifier

| Total of CHA and POW | Social Modifier |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1-10                 | -2d6 *          |
| 11-15                | -1d6 *          |
| 16-25                | +0              |
| 26-30                | +1d6            |
| 31-45                | +2d6            |
| 46-60                | +4d6            |
| Every addtional 15   | +2d6            |

__*If after you have taken away the rolled modifier and the result is under 0, increase it to 1.__

- __Health (HE):__ These determine how much damage the character can sustain before reaching unconsciousness or death.
- 
- __Strain (ST):__ These determine how much mental anguisbh the character can sustain before reaching madness or death.

- __Magic points (MP):__ A measure of the character’s magical energy. Used to activate any spells the character knows.

- __Movement rate (MR):__ This is the amount in metres that a character can move in a five-second Combat Round.

### Step 3: Determine Attributes

To work out your character’s damage modifier, add Strength and Size together and look at the Damage Modifier table.

- Health equals 40+ Size + Constitution + the max of the character's Damage Modifier.

- Strain equals 40+ Intelligence and Power 

- The character’s starting magic points will be equal to the character’s POW.

- Human characters have a Movement rate of 15 metres.

## Skills

Skills are things that the character can do. They represent particular areas of expertise. In-game, the percentage value of the skill is rolled against, using a D100, to work out if a character completes a task in the game. A roll equal to or less than the skill percentage indicates a success.

For example.

> Ethelred has a Dodge of 52%, which means that in combat he has to roll 52 or under on D100 to avoid the incoming blows of his opponent.

What do the Numbers Mean?

The following table translates the skill percentage into a ‘real world’ description of the level of expertise.

| Skill Level   | Expertise | Description |
| :-------  | :----: | ----:    |
| 0-25% |   Novice  |   No experience with the skill and is relying on raw talent and beginner’s luck. |
| 26-50%    | Apprentice    | This level of expertise represents someone actively learning the skill.   |
| 51-75%    | Veteran   | The character is competent with the basic uses of the skill, which they use in everyday life. |
| 76-99%    | Expert    | This character is a local expert at the skill, who can perform it under most conditions with ease and elegance. |
| +100%      | Master    | They are acknowledged as best at that skill, and regularly perform the impossible in challenging conditions. |

100% is not the upper limit for skills, though it is a soft cap. Characters with skills at or above 100% are Masters of their skills, and nearly always succeed, and can impact the skills of others when in competition with them.

### Skill Lists
Skills categorised for easy reference.

- Combat skills measure the character’s skills in physical violence.

- Knowledge skills measure the intellectual abilities of the character.

- Practical skills measure the character’s ability to perform a variety of everyday and specialist tasks.

- Magic skills cover either casting magic or knowledge of religious practices.

*A note about skills with descriptors in brackets. Lore (Type), Religion (Other Religion) and Culture (Other) all have a descriptor in brackets after the main skill name*

| Religion (Other Religion)| INT    |

### Step 4: Calculate Skills

For each skill, calculate the starting skill value, also known as the base score, from the calculation provided. Then write it down on the character sheet next to the skill.

During character generation, the actor gets a pool of points to spend on each group of skills. Distribute points between the skills, with a limit of no more than 30 to be allocated to any one skill.

- Combat: Spend 30 points between the four skills.

- Knowledge: Spend 20 points between the skills.

- Practical: Spend 45 points between skills.
  
__Intelligence Bonus :__ Multiply your INT score by 10 and apply these points to any section you see fit. *Note: this new total still cannot exceed the 30 points per skill.*

*Magic: is special, refer to Generating a Character Step 5 below.*

## Magic

### Step 5: Magic Spells

Look at the spells in the Innate Magic chapter and pick six points of magnitude worth. Also work out Innate Magic Casting Skill, which starts at POW X 3.

## Equipment

Each character typically starts with some money and the tools of their trade.


## Finishing Off the Character

### General Information

- Age: Human characters start at any age between 18 and 28. To randomly determine this, roll 2D6 and add 16.

- Fortune points: Every character starts with two fortune points.

#### What are Fortune Points?

Fortune points are what distinguishes the actor character from the average stay at home type folk. They represent their good fortune and ability to escape life-threatening situations with ease.

Fortune points allow the actor character to do any of the following in game.

- Re-roll any failed dice roll.
- Flip the existing dice result for a failed test so that the units are now the tens and the tens are now the units, so that it is a success.
- Avoid character death. Instead of dying, the character, if reduced to zero or fewer hit points, is merely unconscious. The character remains in such a state until the combat is over, at which point they awaken with one hit point.
- If the character uses Faith Magic, they can spend fortune points invoke their deity and regain a cast spell of their choosing.

*Once spent, fortune points are gone. The Director awards fortune at the end of the game episode for moments of outstanding heroic play.*

In an average Story, each character should also receive two fortune points. Modify this total if the character has performed particularly poorly or heroically, giving a range of between zero and four fortune points to be awarded.

## Background, Appearance and Personality

Even if you do not create a fully written-up background, it is worth making a mental note of what the character is like as a person and roughly what their background is previous to play, as well as visualising what they look like.

### The Character’s Background

The background is useful not only to give the character history before the game starts but also as a way of noting all the intangible elements of the character’s personality. Ethelred’s story later in this chapter is an example of a background.

Writing down a background is optional and can be done either before or after character generation or can even emerge during play.

## Motives

Motives are what drives the character’s actions. They are the character’s goals, both short and long-term.

Season Motives are life motives and are only achievable throughout a linked set of adventures, commonly known as a ‘campaign’ or Season as OpenStory calls it.

Story Motives are usually relevant to the adventure currently being played and are determined near the beginning of the episode by the actors.

At the end of character generation, choose one Season Motive for your character and at the beginning of the adventure, choose a suitable Story Motive.

### Step 6: Finish Off the Character

- Note down fortune points and age.

> For humans, this is 18-28 (2D6+16) respectively for starter adventurers.

- Fortune points starts at 2.

##### Create a Season Motive for the character

If you want to include a background narrative, then do this now.

Finally, if you haven’t done so already, write the character’s name on the character sheet.

## Character Growth

As characters goes through Stories, they grow and improve. In the game, this can be one of the tangible goals for the actors.

There are two methods of increasing capability for characters during a season.
The main currency for achieving this and indicator of how well the character is doing in game terms are growth points or just simply __Growth__. The Director hands these out after a Story.  The second method is organic and driven from skill usage, which will increase skills directly through usage, this method is is called __Learning__.

__Growth__ can happen because of four situations.

- Bringing motives into play, as determined by the actor and approved by the Director.
- Story achievement awards. These are determined and handed out by the Director.
- In game rewards for skill use. If the actor fumbles or criticals during a skill test.
- Ad hoc growth awards. The Director gives these out as a result of certain events occurring during the Story.

__Learning__ occurs when a skill is used during a story.  That skill gets the Learning box check.  At the end of the story, the actors roll for each Learned skill.  In order to increase the skill, they must roll under the skill+their intelligence score.  

### Awarding Growth for Motives

The characters’ motives are the main way actors get to drive play and grow their characters.

If your character completes a motive, either short or long term, during a gaming episode, cross it out.

If you engage with a motive in a gaming episode, bringing it in to play, but don’t complete it, put a * next to it. You can only mark growth once in this way per Story.

Make sure you make these marks as soon as your character achieves them with your Director’s permission.

At the end of the Story, look at your motives.

- +5 growth points if you complete your Season motive.

- +2 growth points if you complete your Story motive.

- +1 for every motive that is brought into play. You don’t get this award as well as the award for completing a motive.

As a result, you should have a total between 1 growth point (you engaged with your short-term Story motive) and 7 growth points (you complete both your Story motive and Season motive).

At this point, rub out any asterisk markers and remove any short-term motives, whether completed or not. Leave the completed long-term motives on the character sheet.

### Motive Review

At the end of each Story, the actor and the Director can call for a Motive Review. During the review, the actor can change Season Motives that are no longer interesting to them or relevant to the character. They can also remove uncompleted Story Motives or carry them over to the next Story, in which case the Director makes a note of them.

#### Director Growth Awards

The Director award character growth as a result of the following.

- Story achievement award is directly linked to how long the story was.
- In game rewards for skill use. If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill test, their actor adds a growth point immediately.
- Ad Hoc awards that acknowledge growth that occurs due to achievements outside of the standard growth system.

#### Story Achievement Awards

At the end of a Story, the Director makes this award, a simple flat award of two growth points for each episode of play of average length of two-three hours. Adjust for longer episodes.

For example, A self-contained one episode one-shot game that took three hours should give two growth points, while a Story that took four episodes, each two to three hours, to play out gives eight growth points to each actor.

*Note: if you want to reward clever or entertaining play, use fortune points instead (see box below).*

#### In Game Rewards for Skill Use

If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill-test, they grow from the experience and the actor immediately records a one-point growth award. The table should also cheer on the actor. There is no limit to how many times this reward can be issued. The reward reflects this author’s belief that we grow from great success or great failure.

#### Ad Hoc Awards

Ad hoc means when necessary or needed.

The characters may grow as part of the Story in ways that are immediate and hard to fit within the context of awarding growth points and the Director wants to make a one off award of a character growth directly linked to the Story.

For example.

> A Wise may teach (for free) the spell of Detect Gold as a reward for completing a Story on their behalf.

### Spending Growth Points

Actors may spend growth points in the downtime between Storys, even when their characters who are badly injured are healing. The default downtime period is three months, although it could drop to mere days if the flow of time in the series of Storys, known as a Season, requires it.


#### Growing Characteristics

A actor can choose to spend five growth points to increase one characteristic by one point.

*SIZ never increases using growth points.*

The maximum a human character can increase a characteristic to is 21. For non-humans, the maximum for a characteristic is equal to the maximum possible starting score for the characteristic plus three.

This type of growth allows the character to overcome the innate weaknesses they suffer due to low characteristic scores.

#### Growing Magic

How the character learns more magic is dealt with in the respective magic chapters (Innate Magic, Faith Magic, and Esoteria). But for convenience the costs are summarised in the following table.

#### Summary of Growth Costs

| Cost                                                     | Growth                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Five growth points                                       | +1 to any characteristic except SIZ       |
| One growth point per magnitude                           | Learn a Innate Magic spell              |
| Two growth points per magnitude                          | Learn a spell or an increase the magnitude of a Faith Magic spell |
| Three growth points                                     | Learn a Esoteria Spell                     |


#### Improving Outside of Storys: Practice And Research

The characters may often experience long stretches of downtime between Storys. Group members may need to heal from wounds suffered during the last Story, the characters may engage in some activity that takes time, or life may return to normal until the next danger to face the actor characters appears.

During such downtime, the actors may improve their characters. The actors might use downtime between Storys to learn new skills, and it is up to the Director to determine if this is appropriate.  This most often will occur by the checking of the Learned box for a skill and a roleplay reason to justify it.

*Example*

> Conrad wishes to improve his religion(own) skill.  He reads a prayer book of Le Vides that his companion has during their rest.  He now may check the __Learned__ box for religion(own)


#### Improving in Magical Rank

There are growth point costs when a character increases their rank in their religions and in Esoteria, and when they become a specialist caster using Innate Magic—explained in more detail in the relevant chapters, along with the benefits.
