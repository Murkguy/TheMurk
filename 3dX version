- Potential - A currency used to empower and reward players.

- Roll-off - A competitive roll used when in direct contest with other players.

## Basic Roll

The Murk uses a 3DX system with 2 dice nearly always being D6s and the third being a **Attribute** die based on the type of roll and the character's skillset.

These dice are totalled along with any flat bonuses given, and then compared to a **Difficulty Rating**.

If the roll's **Total** meets or **Exceeds** the **Difficulty Rating**, that roll is deemed a success and the intent is accomplished.

If a roll fails to meet the Difficulty rating and the Attribute die rolls a 1, this is called a **Botch**

A number of things can add or subtract from rolls, namely **Equipment**, **Suffering**, and **Potential**.


## Making Attribute Rolls

With the exception of **Injury Rolls** and Active Abilities, every roll made in The Murk will be a designated Attribute Roll. This means the following dice will be used.

- 2 six sided dice
- 1 attribute die equivalent to the attribute the action requires rolled

This will be totalled, and then any flat bonuses or penalties will be added to determine success or complication.

## Potential

Potential is a currency that is leveraged by players when the chips are down and something needs to occur. Potential can be saved up and stored during an episode, or spent as it comes.

Actors spend **Potential** doing a number of things

- For every 1 **Potential** spent on a roll, add 1 to the roll unless otherwise noted.
- Every Archetype has active abilities that require spending a number of **Potential** to activate.
- Those using Faith can exchange **Potential** for **Power** in a 1 to 1 trade during a scene.
- Those using Esoteria can leverage **Potential** to shield them from the effects of Backlash.

### Gaining and Losing Potential

Characters can gain **Potential** in a number of ways.

- The GM can reward Potential in relation to a complication they have presented to a Character.
  - This is often based on a Trait and will be accompanied by a **Severity** die based on the difficulty
- The Character gains 1 Potential when their **Attribute** die rolls higher than a 6 on any 3DX roll
- The Character gains X Potential when the d6s of the 3D6 roll are tied, X being the result of their **Attribute** die roll.

Characters can lose **Potential** in the following ways.

- Rolling a 1 on the Character's **Attribute** die during a 3DX roll causes the loss of 1 Potential

# Conjuring Esoteria

Esoteria functions as an **Attribute Roll** with additional steps after it completes.

## Casting Spells

Magic is intended to be dynamic, narrative, and unnatural. For these reasons The Murk refrains from providing explicit spells and capabilities outside a few key areas. There are thousands of Esoteria symbols so when describing magic, the Paragon can use whatever flourish or description they wish to dress the effects of their spells in.

Esoteria is cast using an Esoteria Attribute Roll. First the Actor describes the intent of the casting, and is given both a **Difficulty Rating** and **Magnitude** they would need to accomplish this. Upon making the check success is determined as normal rules, then **Backlash** is applied.

**Weapon damage is often set as the Magnitude of a spell for the purpose of attacks**

## Backlash

Esoterists are quite literally channelling stolen(or given) power from the Gods into their mortal frames. As such they must make an **Attribute Only** roll of their Esoteria VS the Magnitude and absorb Stress equal to the difference.

**Potential** can be used before the roll to gain a bonus on the roll.

## Rituals

Those possessing the latent Esoteric skill can use it to alter reality as they see fit. All that is required is a keen mind, a clear ritual, and a near limitless tolerance to sacrifice the things around you for the goal you have in mind. This functions as an extentsion of normal casting. A ritual effectively enables the Esoterist to make their Backlash rolls in small parts, taking multiple scenes to complete a great and powerful spell.

**For every scene a Esoterist uses a ritual, they may divide up their Backlash by 3 and roll those pieces individually**

## Calling on Faith

Compared to Esoteria, Faith is relatively simple, yet significantly more complex at activation. As part of any **Scene** where there is downtime, a Faithful may pray to their god.

During the prayer, they roll a **Faith Attribute Roll** with a **starting DR of 8+ any Sins since last Prayer**

If successful, they are awarded **Power** in points equal to the difference.

They may use these points at any time to perform **Miracles**

### Miracles

The Faithful may perform a Miracle by doing 2 things.

1. State the intent of the miracle.
2. Stating the Creed they are fulfilling for their god by doing this miracle - or -note which sin they are punishing.
3. Select the amount of Power they wish to use.
4. The Director then assigns a DR for the miracle

They then take a number of their Faith Dice equal to this Power value and roll.

All Power used is used regardless of success or not.

# Combat

## Determining Initiative

Initiative in a conflict Scene is established by each participant in a scene making a roll to determine their Initiative Score. The turn order is then determined by the individual with the highest number, granting them the first opportunity to act. As the Moment concludes, Initiative is recalculated by rolling again and adding it to the previous Initiative, thereby setting the turn order for the next Moment.

### Outpacing

Outpacing happens when one Actor has an Initiative that exceeds another Actor's by five or more. In this situation, the Actor with the higher Initiative gains an advantage, receiving an additional +2 on checks against the opposing Actor for every 5 point increment they are above.

## Determining Distances

Distances play a crucial role in determining the impact of various elements on individuals. To maintain a streamlined gameplay experience without excessive calculations, we utilize a set of distance descriptors that effectively capture the necessary information. These descriptors categorize all distances into five distinct categories.

- Close represents proximity in melee combat and intimate conversations, indicating a range that is within arm's reach.

- Near signifies distances suitable for yelling and throwing objects like an ax, typically encompassing an area of around 30 feet.

- Far denotes ranges relevant to archery and sweeping hand gestures, covering distances of approximately 250 feet.

- Very far encompasses distances where individuals' features are barely discernible and long-range weaponry like rifles come into play, typically within 500 feet.

- Distant refers to distances where only vague shapes of people are visible, offering little detail. This range extends to around 1000 feet.

## In Melee

When in close proximity during a combat scene characters are immediately drawn into a Melee when attacking or Attacked.

In a Melee characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to the difference in Rolls plus their weapon damage.

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Instead of damaging their foes, Characters can choose to escape the Melee and move to the Near distance**

_Melee happens before shootouts and Duels of Magic_

## Shootouts

When in Near or greater proximity during a combat scene characters, and holding ranged weapons, Characters can choose to engage in a shootout.

In a Shootout characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to the difference in Rolls plus their weapon damage.

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Characters can leave a shootout by getting Close or hunkering down and taking no actions**

_Shootouts happen after Melees but before duels of Magic_

## Contest of Powers

When in Near or greater proximity during a combat scene characters who posess Esoteria or Faith can choose to engage in a Contest of Powers.

In a Duel of Powers characters engage in a Roll-off each Moment. The winner applying damage equal to their total roll.

_Faithful must spend 1 Power per moment to Contest_

_Esoterists must take 5 strain each moment to continue the Contest_

When engaging multiple foes, the character must make a Roll-off vs the highest roll from the group of foes. Damaging a group always starts at the lowest Attribute die and ends with the highest.

**Characters can leave a Contest of Power by getting Close or hunkering down and taking no actions**

_Contests of Power happen at the end of the round_

## Into the Fray

People outside Melees, Shootouts, and Contests can often help determine the results. Make an Attribute check for every action you wish to perform outside these mechanics.

## Social and Spiritual Conflict

Engaging in Social or Direct Spiritual combat mirrors Physical combat, commencing with defined objectives for each participant. Each Actor involved in a social situation can opt to attack or defend by utilizing various social or spiritual skills. Through Roll-offs and immersive role-playing, the participants strive to achieve their goals. The winner applying damage equal to their total roll.

### Losing an Argument or Contest

Alternatively, instead of incurring a rank of Suffering, an Actor may choose to concede the argument and allow their opponent's objective to prevail.

# Damage, Death, and Recovery

## Resisting and Dealing Damage

Every weapon and ability has an associated damage rating. This rating is applied when a hit is achieved or a Roll-off is won.

Often damage is applied to the Damage track, but special weapons or even social combat will apply damage to the Strain or Exhaustion tracks.

A base Weapon's Damage is 7 but can vary greatly on quality and size. A cannon does more damage than a dagger, but the greatest magical dagger may be able to outshine a cannon.

_See Quality Tiers for more information_

### Armor

Armor is designed to add bonus dice to your Injury Tracks. Most Armor is physical and applied to your Damage dice pool, but others can be Strain or Exhaustion based.

Armor always uses the associated Attribute die for the Attribute.

## The Injury Tracks

The well-being of characters is intricately tied to their Core Attributes. Three Injury tracks exist, each influenced by these attributes. These tracks are independently monitored and reset at the beginning of each new scene. When damage is inflicted on a track, a corresponding roll must be made. Throughout the scene, whenever damage occurs, a reroll of the new total is required. Injury tracks are based on core attributes for the dice type, and rank for the total number of dice.

The three Injury Dice Types are as follows:

- Damage - Equal to Body Dice

- Strain - Equal to Mind Dice

- Exhaustion - Equal to Spirit Dice

**_The Total number of Dice for each Injury Track is 2+Rank_**

**These rolls 'explode' meaning the highest value of each die results in an additional die being rolled and added to the total.**

Success in these rolls signifies that no lasting effects occur. However, failure to meet the track number results in a rank of Suffering. The total ranks of Suffering incurred reduce the effectiveness of all core attributes accordingly.

## Suffering and Breaking Down

Suffering is the aggregated stress and damage that a Character has taken to their spirtual, moral, and physical self.

Suffering Manifests itself in a set of Ranks. When a new Rank of Suffering is applied from damage, strain, or exhaustion a **Break Down** roll is made.

**Breakdown Roll** is the new total of Suffering Ranks Rolled as D6s. If this total exceeds 20 this character dies or retires from play at the end of the scene.

## Recovery

The more weary of this world a character's body and mind are the more difficult it can be to pull them from the brink.

Recovery can occur when the Character spends an entire scene seeking medical, spiritual, or mental care.

_The intent is to take this character out of action and focus on their healing or internal dialogues_

At the end of the Scene, the Character or those aiding them may make a Attribute Rolloff vs the Character's Breakdown Roll total.

\*_Recovery does not count toward Breakdown rolls for the purposes of retirement or death_

Alternatively, the Director can freely recover 1 or more Suffering at the end of an Episode.

# Equipment

## Quality Tiers

Equipment Tiers categorize the quality and effectiveness of various items in Tellus. Whether it's a worn-out blade or an exquisitely enchanted weapon, the quality of equipment can greatly impact its performance. There are six tiers of equipment, each with its own mechanical benefits:

- Tier 1 - Terrible: Low-quality tools that adds -1 penalty to rolls and can break on a botch.

- Tier 2 - Standard: Average equipment that grants no penalty or bonus to checks.

- Tier 3 - Finely Crafted: Handcrafted items by skilled artisans, providing +1 to any check used.

- Tier 4 - Masterwork: Exceptionally crafted non-magical items that add +2 to any check.

- Tier 5 - Enchanted: Magical items that allow one reroll of 1s on Attribute Dice per scene and also function as Masterwork tools.

- Tier 6 - Artifact: Extraordinary items that provide +3 dice on use and allow one full reroll per scene.

## Weapons

All weapon stats can be reskinned and stylized as both the Actor or Director see fit. Overall the intent is to provide freedom of expression while maintaining some semblance of realism for weaponry.

| Weapon         | Description                                                                                                               | Range | Damage | Cost       |

## Armor, Gear, and Prosthetics

Much like Weapons, all equipment can be reskinned to fit the need of any Actor or Director.

| Equipment   | Example                                                                     | Effect                                                                                              | Cost       |

# Character Details

Archtypes are intended to provide some framework to a Character's skillset and play style. They are a loose collection of Attributes and Talents that intend to paint _part but not all_ of a Character's picture.

## Ranks and Progression

Much like Archetypes, every character has an associated **Rank**. Ranks are a rough determination of capability in relation to others. At the beginning, all Characters have a rank of 1.

Ranks determine a number of things such as

- Basic Injury Dice Pools
- New Talent Costs
- Attribute Maximums

Below is a list of the Ranks and their details.

| Rank           | XP Req | Injury Dice Pool | Talent Costs | Attribute Maximum |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 - Green      | 0      | 3                | 20           | D10               |
| 2 - Freelancer | 100    | 4                | 30           | D10               |
