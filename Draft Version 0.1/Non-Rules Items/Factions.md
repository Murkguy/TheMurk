## Notable Factions

### The Stroidan

The Stroidan, a notorious criminal network that operates in the shadows of Novemgrod, is a clandestine organization renowned for its intricate web of criminal activities and its iron grip on the city's underworld. Born out of the chaos and lawlessness that followed The Black Day, this network has grown to become a formidable force, exerting its influence on every aspect of the city's criminal landscape.

The Stroidan operates with meticulous precision and unwavering ruthlessness. They have established a vast network of skilled criminals, informants, and corrupt officials who help maintain their stranglehold on the city. Under the cover of darkness, The Stroidan orchestrates a wide range of illicit activities, including smuggling, extortion, drug trafficking, and assassination.

One of the key figures within The Stroidan is Viktor Volkov, a cunning and ruthless crime lord who commands respect and fear from both his subordinates and rival factions. Viktor has established his dominance by capitalizing on the weakened state of the city's law enforcement, as the royal guard has been unable to replenish its ranks. He has taken over the security operations in Novemgrod, providing protection to businesses and residents in exchange for a hefty fee. While his gang may engage in extortion and other criminal acts, they also play a role in maintaining a fragile semblance of order in the city, preventing total anarchy from taking hold.

The Stroidan thrives on secrecy and operates through a complex system of codes, hidden symbols, and covert communication channels. Its members wear black veils or masks, obscuring their identities and adding an air of mystique to their criminal activities. This secrecy allows the organization to evade the prying eyes of the authorities and maintain control over their illicit operations.

Within the criminal network, there are various specialized divisions, each with their own area of expertise. These divisions include skilled thieves, master forgers, talented assassins, and adept hackers. The Stroidan prides itself on recruiting individuals with unique skills and exceptional abilities, ensuring that they have a competitive edge over rival criminal organizations and law enforcement agencies.

While The Stroidan operates primarily for its own gain, it is not uncommon for them to strike deals or form temporary alliances with other criminal groups or corrupt officials to further their influence and protect their interests. They have a reputation for being swift and merciless in dealing with those who betray their trust or attempt to undermine their operations.

The true extent of The Stroidan's influence and power remains a mystery to most, as their activities are shrouded in darkness and secrecy. Their vast network extends far beyond the borders of Novemgrod, infiltrating neighboring cities and regions, making them a force to be reckoned with in the criminal underworld.

The Stroidan represents a constant threat to the fragile stability of Novemgrod, with their activities undermining the efforts of law-abiding citizens and posing challenges to the authorities. The Prince and other key figures in the city must tread carefully, aware that The Stroidan's reach extends into the highest echelons of power. Unmasking and dismantling this criminal network is a formidable task that requires unwavering determination and strategic cunning.

### The Bannerless

In its early days, the primary objective of The Bannerless was to bridge the divides between the factions and ensure lasting stability. The founding members understood that by uniting the soldiers who had fought on opposite sides, they could foster understanding, heal wounds, and forge a path towards reconciliation. Their aim was to create a new era marked by cooperation and mutual respect.

As the war ended three decades ago, many of the original founders have now passed on the mantle to the next generation.

Bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood are forged across cities and regions, fostering a spirit of camaraderie, respect, and shared purpose.
While the chapters maintain their own local operations and initiatives, they remain united under the banner of The Bannerless. Regular gatherings, training sessions, and exchange programs are held to foster a sense of unity and to ensure that members benefit from the collective knowledge and experiences of their peers.

The Bannerless's strength lies not only in the diverse skills and expertise of its members but also in the solidarity and mutual support they offer one another. Members from different chapters often come together to tackle larger threats that transcend city boundaries, drawing on their collective resources and knowledge to face challenges with a united front.

As The Bannerless continues to evolve and expand, its influence and impact spread across the realms.

### The Foundation

The Foundation, a mysterious organization that resides in the shadows, has garnered its fair share of critics who claim that there is more to it than meets the eye. While publicly presenting themselves as an esteemed group of intellectuals and scholars, their detractors argue that The Foundation conceals a darker agenda beneath its fa√ßade of enlightenment.

At the helm of this clandestine organization are a group of disenchanted nobles, who may outwardly serve Prince Ruvan but harbor a deep dissatisfaction with his rule. These individuals, yearning for greater influence and power, find solace within the folds of The Foundation. It is here that they convene, sharing their discontent and plotting their own clandestine endeavors.

Central to The Foundation's operations is their private library, meticulously curated to house a vast collection of Esoteria. This secretive repository serves as a gathering place for the members, granting them exclusive access to ancient and forbidden knowledge. Within the hallowed halls of the library, esoteric texts and artifacts are preserved and studied, delving into the realms of magic, mysticism, and the occult.

However, The Foundation's activities extend beyond the pursuit of esoteric knowledge. While they engage in philanthropic efforts that are seemingly driven by a desire to uplift the community, their true motivations lie in achieving ulterior goals. Behind the veil of charitable endeavors, they strategically deploy their resources and influence to manipulate situations to their advantage. These acts of philanthropy serve as a means to gain favor, influence key individuals, or secure crucial alliances necessary for their hidden agendas.
The Foundation's true intentions and the extent of their actions remain shrouded in secrecy. Whispers among the populace hint at their involvement in covert operations, political maneuverings, and even darker rituals. Critics allege that The Foundation's pursuit of power and control surpasses their professed commitment to enlightenment and progress.

While some may view The Foundation as a beacon of knowledge and intellectual prowess, others regard it with suspicion and fear. They question the true nature of this organization, wary of the hidden forces that may be at play behind closed doors. As rumors swirl and dissenting voices grow louder, The Foundation's grip on the shadows tightens, concealing their true motives and leaving the populace to wonder what machinations lie beneath their enlightened facade.

### Temnovus

Deep in the shadows of Novemgrad, a mysterious and clandestine group known as the Temnovus thrives, shrouded in secrecy and darkness. Their members remain elusive and hidden, their identities veiled behind a web of intrigue and anonymity. No one knows for certain who is part of this enigmatic organization, as they operate with utmost discretion, silently moving through the city's corridors undetected.

The Temnovus, driven by an insatiable fascination with the dark, have left their mark upon the city's landscape. From time to time, their symbol emerges, painted in cryptic patterns upon public areas. It serves as a chilling reminder of their presence, an invitation to those who dare to seek the secrets they hold. Yet, it is not only in public displays that their symbol manifests. In the depths of hidden chambers and forsaken corners, the Temnovus conducts their dark rituals, invoking forces beyond comprehension. Authorities stumble upon these eerie symbols, evidence of the Temnovus' sinister practices, fueling speculation and fear.

Rumors abound that the Temnovus worships The Murk, an entity shrouded in mystique and darkness. Some believe that the cult channels the very power of The Murk, drawing upon its enigmatic energy for their own purposes. The Murk's association with chaos and the unknown instills a sense of unease in the hearts of the people, further fueling the suspicion surrounding the Temnovus.

Despite being strictly forbidden in Novemgrad, the allure of the Temnovus persists. The city's authorities have waged a relentless battle to suppress their activities, but their efforts have met limited success. Symbols of the Temnovus continue to materialize in unexpected places, a silent defiance against the established order. And people, unfortunate souls, occasionally vanish without a trace, their disappearances seemingly linked to the enigmatic cult.

In the darkness of night, the Temnovus thrives, weaving its web of secrets and manipulating the unseen forces that dwell within the shadows. Novemgrad remains a city plagued by the lingering presence of this forbidden cult, its symbol a haunting reminder of their existence, and the uncertainty of what lies hidden in the depths of their twisted devotion.
