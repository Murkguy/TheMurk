### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d10 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. 

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Knave table.

### Thieves’ Cant

During your knave training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You cantake a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your knave abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you tomake a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Roguish Archetypes

Knaves have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different knaves steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the knave archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

### Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do knaves who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

#### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

#### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

#### Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Use Magic Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

#### Thief’s Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

### Charlatan

#### Deceptive Charm
Starting at 3rd level, you gain expertise in Deception and Persuasion skills if you don't already have them. Additionally, you can use your Sneak Attack feature against a creature that you have successfully deceived or persuaded during the current encounter, provided that creature is within 5 feet of you and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Misdirection
Also at 3rd level, you can use your cunning to create distractions and mislead others. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Knave spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is distracted, granting advantage to your allies' attack rolls against it until the start of your next turn.

#### Silver Tongue
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks made during social interactions. Additionally, when you make a Charisma check you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the check if you are not already proficient.

#### Social Ambusher
At 13th level, you excel at ambushing foes during social engagements. When you roll initiative and are not surprised, you can choose to take a bonus action to Hide if you are in a situation where stealth is possible (such as a crowded room, dim light, or similar conditions). If you succeed on the Hide check, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against a creature that hasn't acted yet in the combat, as long as the attack is made within the next minute, if this attack hits, it is an automatic critical hit.

#### Master of Deception
Starting at 17th level, your mastery of deception knows no bounds. You can use your action to adopt a new persona for 1 hour, during which time you gain advantage on all Charisma checks made to deceive, persuade, or intimidate creatures that you interact with while in this persona. Additionally, once during this duration, you can automatically succeed on a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check against a creature that isn't hostile toward you.

This archetype focuses on using social skills to gain advantages in combat and deception, making the Charlatan Knave a master manipulator in both social and combat situations.
