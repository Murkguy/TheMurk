- **Archery**
  - You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.

### Second Wind
You can fight on where lesser warriors would fail. Also at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Soldier level. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

Upon reaching 14th level, you can use your Second Wind bonus action twice between each short or long rest.

### Martial Exploits
At 2nd level, you begin to learn techniques that enhance your martial skill in and out of battle. You gain the features below:

#### Exploit Dice
The Soldier table shows the number of Exploit Dice you have to perform any Exploits you know. Most Exploits require you to expend these Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain all Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begin as d10s and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Soldier table.

#### Exploits Known
You know two Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this class. The Exploits Known column of the Soldier table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn an Exploit you must meet any prerequisites it may have, like a minimum Ability Score or a minimum Soldier level.

Whenever you gain a Soldier level, you can replace one of the Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice.

#### Saving Throws
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Exploit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

### Know Your Enemy
Beginning at 3rd level, you can evaluate the potential of others with a glance. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. You learn if it is your equal, superior, or inferior in one of the following attributes:

| Armor Class          | Strength Score     |
| Current Hit Points   | Dexterity Score    |
| Hit Point Maximum    | Constitution Score |
| Walking Speed        | Exploits Known     |

Once you use this feature to learn something about a creature, you can't use it on that creature again until you complete a short or long rest.

When you reach 14th level, you can use this feature to learn of your foe's strengths through battle. Once per turn, you can use this feature when you hit with a weapon attack, and you can use this feature to learn three things about a creature between each short or long rest.

### Battle Archetype
At 3rd level, choose the Battle Archetype from the options below that best represents your skills and training: Arcane Knight, Champion, Commander, Marksman, or Master at Arms.

Also included at the end of this class are Archetypes inspired by official Soldier options: Knight Errant, Mystic, Ronin, Runecarver, Shadowdancer, and Sylvan Archer.

Your Battle Archetype grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th levels.

### Archetype Exploits
Some Archetypes have a list of Archetype Exploits that you learn at the Soldier levels noted in the Archetype description. They don't count against your number of Exploits Known and can't be switched out for other Exploits. If you do not meet an Archetype Exploit's prerequisites, you learn it regardless.

### Ability Score Improvement
At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two different ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the number of attacks you can make as part of your Attack action increases; at 11th level (3 attacks) and at 17th level (4 attacks).

### Action Surge
Starting at 6th level, you can push yourself past your limits, if only for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on that current turn. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

When you reach 20th level, you can use this feature twice between each short or long rest, but only once per turn.

### Indomitable
Your fighting spirit allows you to grasp success from the jaws of defeat. Beginning at 9th level, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

At certain Soldier levels, you can use this feature additional times between each long rest. You can use this feature twice starting at 13th level, and three times starting at 17th level.

### Martial Superiority
Your martial skill eclipses even that of professional warriors. Starting at 11th level, whenever you use your Second Wind feature you regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.

Also, you regain all expended Exploit dice if you spend 10 minutes doing only activity that would be part of a short rest.

### Relentless
At 20th level, your skills in combat are those of legend. When you roll initiative, you regain all expended Exploit Dice.

Also, if you start your turn with no Exploit Dice remaining, you immediately regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.

### Battle Archetypes

Choose the Battle Archetype that best represents the skill and training your Soldier has received: the Arcane Knight, Champion, Commander, Marksman, or Master at Arms.

### Commander

Not all Soldiers rely solely on themselves in battle; some lead others with their knowledge of tactics. Commanders lead at the front, issuing orders and inspiring greatness in others by their own brave deeds. By their presence, a Commander can transform an unorganized militia into a deadly fighting force.

#### Commander Exploits

3rd-level Commander Archetype feature

You learn certain Tactical Exploits from the Warlord Class at the Soldier levels noted in the table below. They don't count against your total number of Exploits Known.

#### Inspiring Commands

15th-level Commander Archetype feature

Once per turn when you use a Tactical Exploit that targets at least one friendly creature, one target of your choice gains temporary hit points equal to your Leadership modifier.


### Marksman

While all Soldiers learn to draw a bow or hurl a javelin, those known as Marksmen are masters of ranged combat. The deadly skills of a Marksman are often backed up by their signature swagger and unshakable confidence. When combined, there are few challenges that a true Marksman cannot overcome.

#### Marksman's Focus

3rd-level Marksman Archetype feature

You can quiet your body to fire with deadly accuracy. When you begin your turn and are not surprised or incapacitated, you can choose to enter a state of Focus, which imposes the following benefits and effects until the end of your turn:

- Your speed is reduced to 0 feet.
- Until you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you have advantage on all ranged weapon attack rolls.
- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a ranged weapon, you can re-roll the die. You must use this new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Cunning Shot

7th-level Marksman Archetype feature

Your reflexes are almost supernaturally fast. You add your proficiency bonus to your Initiative rolls while conscious.

You have also learned to identify and exploit even the smallest weak points in your enemy's defenses. Your attacks with ranged weapons ignore resistance to piercing damage.

#### Reposition

10th-level Marksman Archetype feature

When you use Second Wind, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and any opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage until the end of your current turn.

#### Reliable Shot

You make even impossible shots with ease. Your normal and long range for ranged weapon attacks increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times your Soldier level.

Also, once per turn, when you have advantage on a ranged weapon attack, you can forgo advantage and make one additional ranged weapon attack.

#### Legendary Marksman

18th-level Marksman Archetype feature

Your marksmanship is supernaturally accurate. When you Focus, the benefits last for 1 minute, and you have advantage on all ranged weapon attacks for the duration. Finally, your speed is only reduced to 10 feet. At the start of your turn, you can end your Focus (no action required).


### Master at Arms

While most Soldiers master one specific martial discipline, a Master at Arms is the rare warrior who is able to truly master multiple styles of combat. Whether through grit, dedication, or extraordinary skill, these elite Soldiers learn all they can about the theory of combat. A Master at Arms is always on the lookout for a new weapon or style of fighting to master.

#### Advanced Technique

3rd-level Master at Arms Archetype feature

Your ability to learn and execute martial techniques exceeds that of most other warriors and even other trained Soldiers. You gain the following benefits to your Soldier features:

- Exploits. You learn two 1st-degree Martial Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this class. These Exploits do not count against your total number of Exploits Known.

- You learn additional Martial Exploits following the same rules at certain levels: at 5th level you learn two 2nd-degree Exploits, and at 9th level, you learn one 3rd-degree Exploit.

- Exploit Dice. Your total number of Exploit Dice increases by 1, and all of your Exploit Dice increase to become d12s.

- At certain Soldier levels your Exploit Dice increase again; at 5th level they are 2d8s, and at 11th level, they are 2d10s.

- Fighting Styles. You learn one additional Fighting Style of your choice from those available to the Soldier. However, you can only benefit from one Fighting Style that you gained from the Soldier Class or this Master at Arms feature at a time.

  As a bonus action, you can switch your current Fighting Style for another Soldier Fighting Style that you know.

  You learn an additional Fighting Style of your choice at 7th level, and again when you reach 15th level in this class.

#### Master of Forms

7th-level Master at Arms Archetype feature

Your skill allows you to learn exotic techniques from a variety of disciplines. You learn two Exploits of your choice from any class. If the Exploits have a prerequisite level, you can learn them as long as your Soldier level meets that prerequisite.

You learn one additional Exploit of your choice from any class at 15th level, and one final Exploit at 18th level.

#### Masterful Surge

10th-level Master at Arms Archetype feature

When you Action Surge, you gain a single Exploit Die that must be used as part of the additional action you gain. If not used, it disappears at the end of your additional action.

Also, you can benefit from two of the Fighting Styles you know, but you can only switch one as a bonus action.

#### Battle of Legend

18th-level Master at Arms Archetype feature

Your mastery of the weapons of war is near-supernatural. Once per turn when you use an Exploit in combat, you can roll a d10 in place of expending an Exploit Die.

Also, over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can practice your techniques to replace one Exploit you know with a Martial Exploit of the same degree.
