### Esoteria

Trained for years in Magister's Tower of a great city, you've learned the secrets of the black circle and thus may cast spells using Esoteria.  
  - **Capabilities:**
    - **Reach Beyond:** Cast spells at higher levels by succeeding a Knowledge (Arcana) check (DC 15 + twice the spell level).
      - Success: Spell cast at intended level, inflicting 1 strain damage per spell point used.
      - Failure:
        - Option 1: Spell fails, causing strain damage.
        - Option 2: Spell succeeds at cost of personal life force, taking 1d4 HP damage per spell point used.
    - **Delve Deep:** Cast spells without sufficient spell points by making an Arcana check (DC 15 + double the spell level).
      - Success: Spell cast as intended, with strain damage incurred.
      - Failure:
        - Option 1: Spell fails, causing strain damage.
        - Option 2: Spell succeeds at cost of personal life force, taking 1d4 HP damage per spell point used.

Esoteria grants Magisters extraordinary flexibility in spellcasting, allowing them to exceed conventional limits but at the risk of personal harm.

As a student of arcane magic, you have a codex containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the magister spell list. You learn additional magister cantrips of your choice at higher levels.

#### Codex

At 1st level, you have a codex containing six 1st-level magister spells of your choice. Your codex is the repository of the magister spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Magister table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend points of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of magister spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of magister spells from your codex equal to your Intelligence modifier + your magister level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell points.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level magister, you have 14 spell points. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your codex. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level point total. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of magister spells requires time spent studying your codex and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your magister spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magister spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- **Spell save DC:** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier:** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a magister spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your codex. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your magister spells.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a magister level, you can add two magister spells of your choice to your codex for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell points, as shown on the Magister table.

#### Esoteric Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your codex. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell points to recover. The spell points are equal to your Magister Level plus your Intelligence Modifier.


#### Esoteric Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Esoteric Knowledge

When you reach 3rd level, and every odd level to 17th, you may select 1 additional spell from any spell list that is 1 level lower than your maximum spell level.  These spells count as Magister spells for the purpose of your casting them.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level magister spell and a 2nd-level magister spell that are in your codex. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell points when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell points as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

#### Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level magister spells in your codex as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending spell points. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend spell points as normal.


## Esoteric Traditions

The study of magistery is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Magisters through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even magisters who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

## Wizard Subclass: Daemonologist

As a Daemonologist, you specialize in conjuring daemons, creatures of pure thought that you manifest into physical forms to serve your bidding. By delving into the depths of forbidden knowledge, you have gained mastery over these otherworldly entities, bending them to your will.

### Daemon Conjure

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon daemons to aid you in your endeavors. As an action, you can expend a spell points to summon a daemon of your choice from the Daemon Summoning list below. The summoned daemon appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you and obeys your verbal commands. The daemon remains for 1 hour, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Daemon Summoning List

Choose one daemon from the list below when you summon a daemon using your Daemon Conjure feature:

1. **Shadow Stalker:** A stealthy and agile daemon that excels in reconnaissance and sabotage.
2. **Flame Fiend:** A fiery daemon wreathed in flames, capable of burning foes with its scorching attacks.
3. **Frost Wraith:** An icy daemon that freezes the air around it, chilling enemies to the bone with its frosty touch.
4. **Spectral Specter:** A ghostly daemon that can phase through walls and strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.
5. **Venomous Viper:** A serpent-like daemon with poisonous fangs that can paralyze foes with its toxic bite.
6. **Thunder Titan:** A towering daemon wreathed in crackling electricity, capable of unleashing devastating lightning strikes.

### Enhanced Daemon

Starting at 6th level, the daemons you summon through your Daemon Conjure feature gain additional abilities. Choose one of the following enhancements for your summoned daemon:

1. **Empowered Attacks:** The daemon's attacks deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
2. **Resilient Form:** The daemon gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard level at the start of each of its turns.
3. **Unseen Passage:** The daemon gains the ability to turn invisible at will, remaining unseen until it attacks or takes damage.

### Master of Daemons

At 10th level, your mastery over daemons reaches new heights. You can now summon two daemons simultaneously when you use your Daemon Conjure feature. Additionally, the duration of your summoned daemons is extended to 8 hours, and they can understand any language you speak.

### Daemon Overlord

Upon reaching 14th level, you ascend to the pinnacle of daemonology, becoming a true Daemon Overlord. Your summoned daemons gain the following benefits:

- They have advantage on all saving throws.
- Their attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks.
- Once per turn, when a daemon deals damage to a creature, it can cause that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of the daemon until the end of its next turn.

## Wizard Subclass: Ritualist

As a Ritualist, you specialize in the art of performing intricate rituals to enhance your magical abilities and unlock the full potential of your spells. Through diligent study and disciplined practice, you have gained insight into the arcane rituals that shape the fabric of reality.

### Ritual Mastery

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. Additionally, you learn two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice that have the ritual tag, which don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

### Ritual Casting

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast spells as rituals. You can cast any wizard spell you have prepared as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

### Enhanced Spells

Starting at 6th level, you learn to perform rituals that enhance the power of your existing spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher as a ritual, you can choose one of the following enhancements:

1. **Empowered Casting:** The spell's damage is increased by your Intelligence modifier.
2. **Extended Duration:** The spell's duration is doubled.
3. **Area of Effect:** The spell's area of effect is increased by 50%.

### Master Ritualist

At 10th level, your mastery of rituals allows you to perform them with greater efficiency. You can now cast any wizard spell you have prepared as a ritual without expending spell points. Additionally, you can cast rituals in half the usual time, and you can perform rituals even if you are unable to speak or gesture.

### Arcane Augmentation

Upon reaching 14th level, you unlock the ability to infuse your spells with potent arcane energy. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher as a ritual, you can expend additional spell points to further augment its effects. For each spell point you expend in this way, the spell gains one of the enhancements listed in the Enhanced Spells feature.

### Master of Arcane Rites

At 18th level, you become a true master of arcane rites. You gain the following benefits:

- You can cast any wizard spell you have prepared as a ritual without expending a spell points, regardless of whether it has the ritual tag.
- When you cast a spell as a ritual, you can choose two enhancements from the Enhanced Spells feature instead of one.
- The duration of spells cast as rituals is further doubled, and their area of effect is increased by an additional 50%.

## Wizard Subclass: Battlemage

As a Battlemage, you blend martial prowess with arcane mastery, specializing in the art of battle magic to defend allies and unleash devastating spells upon your enemies. Whether on the front lines or commanding from the rear, you are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

### Arcane Combatant

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, simple weapons, and one martial weapon of your choice. Additionally, when you cast a wizard cantrip that deals damage, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

### Arcane Ward

At 2nd level, you learn to create a protective shield of magical energy that absorbs damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend spell points to create a magical ward that reduces the damage taken. The ward absorbs a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the expended spell points plus your Intelligence modifier.

### Arcane Strike

Starting at 6th level, you can infuse your weapon attacks with arcane energy, allowing you to deal additional damage. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend spell points to deal extra force damage equal to the level of the expended spell points plus your Intelligence modifier.

### Arcane Bulwark

At 10th level, your mastery of defensive magic reaches new heights. You gain resistance to force damage, and you can use your Arcane Ward feature as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, when you create your Arcane Ward, you can choose to have it absorb all damage from a single attack instead of reducing the damage taken.

### Master of Destruction

Upon reaching 14th level, you become a master of unleashing destructive magic upon your foes. Whenever you cast a wizard spell that deals damage, you can choose to maximize the damage dealt, instead of rolling for damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Avatar of Arcana

At 18th level, you transcend the boundaries between magic and martial prowess, becoming an embodiment of arcane power on the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- You can use your Arcane Ward feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) without expending spell points.
- Whenever you deal damage with a wizard spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.
- When you roll initiative and have no remaining uses of your Arcane Ward, you regain one use.
