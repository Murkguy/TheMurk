#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.
 
#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Priest table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend points of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of priest spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must beof a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-­‐‑level priest, 14 spell points. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell cure wounds, you can cast it as a 1st-- - level or 2nd-- - level spell. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells. The power of your spells comes fromyour devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

### Faith and Religion

Choose one diety, such as The Penitent Choir. Each faith is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you religion spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Faith when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Religious Spells

Each religion has a list of spells—its religion spells— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the religion description. Once you gain a religion spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a religion spell that doesn’t appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a priest spell for you.

#### Channel Faith

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Other and an effect determined by your religion. Some religions grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the religion description.

When you use your Channel Faith, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Faith again.

Some Channel Faith effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Faith twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Faith: Turn Other

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the outsiders. Each outsider that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
 
 
### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Other

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Other feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Other table.

| Priest Level | Destroys Other of CR . . . |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower              |
| 8th          | 1 or lower                |
| 11th         | 2 or lower                |
| 14th         | 3 or lower                |
| 17th         | 4 or lower                |




### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priest religion spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Religions of Tellus

### The Charred One:
This deity represents death, fire, hatred, fear, and pain. Their followers seek the destruction and unmaking of all creation, employing manipulation, intrigue, and acts of destruction to fulfill their goals. They find solace in the burned-out cities and ruins, spreading their mad god's will.

#### Charred one Spell List
| Priest Level | Spells                      |

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this religion at 1st level, you gain the Firebolt cantrip if you don't already know it. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

#### Channel Divinity: Touch of Destruction
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature or object with flame. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra fire damage to the target. The damage equals 10 + twice your cleric level.

#### Inescapable Destruction
Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel destructive energy becomes more potent. Fire damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to fire damage.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with fire energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an a 1d12 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d12.

#### Destructive Form

Starting at 17th level, you may use Channel Divinity to deal your Touch of Destruction to everyone within 30 feet.  The save for this is equal to your spell save for priest.


### The High Nine:
 Focused on fate, power, cold, life, and death, the High Nine emphasize embracing the currents of life and the wisdom offered by their gods. Listeners, their followers, reach beyond the present moment to connect with ancient chants and words, becoming vessels of fate.

 #### The High Nine Spell List
| Priest Level | Spells                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------|

| 9th          | 	Destructive Wave, Geas |

#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

#### Wrath of the Giants
Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d12 cold and 1d12 bludgeoning on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Strands of Fate
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see and manipulate the strands of fate that weave around other individuals. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for up to 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever another creature you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can use a reaction to give the roll advantage or disadvantage (your choice).

#### Frozen Embrace
At 6th level, when you deal cold damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you and reduce it's movement speed by 10 for 1 minute.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Proficiency Bonus and Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Visions of the Future
At 17th level, your knowledge of the future allows you to guide an individual to achieve their greatest possible success. You can cast the Foresight spell once without expending a spell slot; when you cast the spell in this way, the spell’s duration is 1 minute for that casting. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Makru:
 Revered as the patron deity in many cities, Makru embodies power, life, law, creation, and unity. The followers of Makru are diligent, community-focused individuals who value justice and unification. They are staunch opponents of the Charred One, seeking to protect and preserve Makru's great works.

#### Makru Spell List
| Priest Level | Spells                      |

If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see.

If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

#### Channel Divinity: Commanding Aura
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

#### Forge Soul
Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:
- You gain resistance to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d12 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d12.

#### Flame Saint
At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

- You gain immunity to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

### Xelas:
 Representing knowledge, power, creation, light, and unity, Xelas is the younger sibling of Makru. Xelas's followers are characterized by their pursuit of knowledge and inspiration, welcomed in most cities as wise men and advisors. They hold sacred rituals and engage in the accumulation of knowledge, guided by their god.

#### Channel Divinity: Whispers of the EverScribe
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have expertise with the chosen skill or tool.

#### Spell Breaker
Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Proficiency Bonus and Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### The EverScribe's Chosen
At 17th level, you choose four spells from the wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of religion spells. Like your other religion spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.  You may exchange 1 spell for one of equal level during a long rest.

### Larantas:
 Known as the Great Tree, Larantas is associated with life, creation, light, earth, and death. The Annirad tribe considers it their living god, and the protectors of the Elder Forest safeguard it. Followers of Larantas undertake pilgrimages to be baptized in its nectar, and their faith is tied to the changing seasons.

#### Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.

#### Dampen Elements
Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d12 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d12.

#### Supreme Healing
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

### The Penitent Choir:
 Formed from the remnants of the Church of Le Vides after the The Black Day, the Penitent Choir focuses on life, unity, peace, law, and fate. They believe in atoning for mankind's sins through acts of love and suffering, championing the cause of the neglected and vulnerable.

#### Circle of Mortality
At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

In addition, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Emboldening Song
Starting at 1st level, you can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them. While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.

#### Channel Divinity: Song of Peace
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

#### Sentinel at Death's Door
At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
