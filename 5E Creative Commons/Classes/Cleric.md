#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.
 
#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Priest table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend points of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of priest spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must beof a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-­‐‑level priest, 14 spell points. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell cure wounds, you can cast it as a 1st-- - level or 2nd-- - level spell. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells. The power of your spells comes fromyour devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

### Faith and Religion

Choose one diety, such as The Penitent Choir. Each faith is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you religion spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Faith when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Religious Spells

Each religion has a list of spells—its religion spells— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the religion description. Once you gain a religion spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a religion spell that doesn’t appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a priest spell for you.

#### Channel Faith

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Other and an effect determined by your religion. Some religions grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the religion description.

When you use your Channel Faith, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Faith again.

Some Channel Faith effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Faith twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

##### Channel Faith: Turn Other

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the outsiders. Each outsider that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
 
 
### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Other

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Other feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Other table.

| Priest Level | Destroys Other of CR . . . |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower              |
| 8th          | 1 or lower                |
| 11th         | 2 or lower                |
| 14th         | 3 or lower                |
| 17th         | 4 or lower                |




### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priest religion spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
