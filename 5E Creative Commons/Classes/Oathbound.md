### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or other within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or other) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.


### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your oathbound level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on other and constructs.

### Oathbound Weapon
Your devotion is so powerful that your weapon is bathed in energy. Each  attack you perform adds the listed dice as damage. The damage type is the same as the base attack, but Oaths adjust them at level 3. 

### Auras
At 1st level, your mere presence is enough to inspire allies and protect them with your holy power. There are two kinds of auras a oathbound can know, major and minor. You begin play knowing 1 of each. When you gain certain oathbound levels, you gain additional auras of your choice, as shown in the major aura and minor aura columns of the oathbound table.

You may only have 1 aura, of either type, active. You may use your bonus action to activate or switch your aura. The aura affects you and all allies within 10 feet of you, at 11th level this distance increases to 30ft. and at 17th level it increases to 60ft. Your aura bonus is equal to you Charisma modifier.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.  You gain an additional fighting style at level 9.

Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield

Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Divine Health
By 2nd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

### Sacred Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a oathbound forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. The Oaths are detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include the Channel Divinity feature and other features.

### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your oathbound spell save DC.

Beginning at 13th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn the Other
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and other, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or other that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

### Sacred Oaths
Choose from Oath of Compassion, Oath of Zealous Action, Oath of Radiance

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Bastion of Faith
Starting at 6th level, you may now have both a major aura and a minor aura active at the same time.

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Divine Intervention

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priest religion spell would be appropriate.
