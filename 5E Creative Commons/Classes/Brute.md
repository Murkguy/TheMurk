#### Wrath

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a wrath as a bonus action.

While in wrath, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using or a ranged attack from less than 30 ft, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a brute, as shown in the Wrath Damage column of the Brute table.

- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in wrath.

Your wrath lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if yourturn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your wrath on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have wrathd the number of times shown for your brute level in the Wrath column of the Brute table, you must finish a long rest before you can wrath again.

#### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

 
#### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls or ranged attack rolls within 30ft during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away fromdanger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

#### Wrathful Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your wrath. Choose the Path of the Reaver or the Path of Living Steel, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

#### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your wrath before doing anything else on that turn.
 
#### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

#### Relentless Wrath

Starting at 11th level, your wrath can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re in wrath and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

#### Persistent Wrath

Beginning at 15th level, your wrath is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

#### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Ruinous Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the ruins.

Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4.

Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

### Path of the Reaver

For some brutes, wrath is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Reaver is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the reaver’s wrath, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-­‐‑being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you enter wrath. If you do so, for the duration of your wrath you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. At the end of the round you must make a DC 15 wisdom save or suffer 1d6 strain damage.
 
#### Mindless Wrath

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while in wrath. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your wrath, the effect is suspended for the duration of the wrath.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your nextturn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Path of Living Steel

Your brutal existence culimated in the inclusion of mechanical and alchemical technology into your body.  The once dormant systems that gave you your potent anger now reactivate and begin to take hold.  What will you become?  A killing machine?  Or a will you retain what makes you human?

#### Machine Soul

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your wrathful nature becomes mechanical.  While Wrathful, you gain resistance to necrotic damage, immunity to sleep, and no longer need to breathe.  Whenever you are dealt lightning damage, you must make a DC 15 Consitution save or add an additional 1d8 to the damage taken.

#### One with Metal

Starting at 6th level, the Brute can wear heavy armor and is no longer restricted in using wrath while in heavy armor.  In addition, when they don armor, they can choose to make this armor part of their body. Doing so provides them the associated armor mastery feet and allows them to rest while in armor.

#### Living Weapon

Starting at 10th level, the Brute can fuse weapons to their body when entering wrath.  The weapons cannot be disarmed in any way, and ranged weapons lose their loading property for the duration of wrath.

#### New Skin

Starting at 10th level the Brute ignores maximum dexterity bonuses when applied to fused armor.

#### Cybernetic Organism

Starting at 14th level, your body loses all organic traces while in wrath.  When you reach 0 hp during wrath, you may roll a DC 8+Damage Done Constitution Check.  If successful you regain 1d12 HP and may continue the scene.
