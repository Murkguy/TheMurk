### Favored Enemy

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of
 
humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.  

You deal 1d6 bonus in damage when dealing damage to them with weapons.  This damage increases to 1d8 at 6th level and 2d6 at 14th level.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

### Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or murk. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

•	Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
•	Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
•	Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
•	If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
•	When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
•	While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
 
Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-­‐‑weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Second Wind
At 2nd level You have a limited well of stamina you can draw upon to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your ranger level. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
 
### Primeval Awareness
Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.


### Pathfinder Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.


### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Wilderness Medicine
In their favored terrain, the ranger is adept at utilizing local flora and fauna with healing properties. Dungeon Stalkers are similarly familiar with various subterranean mosses, lichens, spider silk, etc. Medicine checks in favored terrain are made using the ranger’s proficiency bonus. Once per day, given an hour of preparation time, you can craft potions or poultices (1d4 uses) that will heal hit points equal to 1d8+ the ranger’s level. In addition, these items will halt (cure) the progression of any non-magical disease contracted the same day. In a similar fashion, the ranger can craft an antitoxin to counter the effects of poison (1 use per hour spent). All items crafted by the ranger in this manner are perishable and need to be used within one day of being created, or they will spoil and be useless. Use of this feature requires an herbalism kit.

### Fleet of Foot
Beginning at 7th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Land’s Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

### Environmental Resilience
At 9th level in their favored terrain, the ranger makes all Constitution checks with advantage. The ranger gains the following damage resistance based on their favored terrain, but it applies at all times:

Arctic Cold
Coast Cold
Desert Fire
Forest Cold
Grassland Cold
Mountain Cold
Swamp Poison
Underdark Poison

The damage resistance granted by this feature can only be taken once, using the ranger’s original choice of favored terrain. Additional favored terrains do not grant additional damage resistances.

### Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

 
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

### Stalker’s Flurry
Starting at 13th level, once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack, you can make another attack.

### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

Improved Wilderness Medicine
You gain proficiency in Medicine. When using the Wilderness Medicine feature, the ranger’s potions or poultices restore hits points equal to 2d8 + the ranger’s level. In addition to being a preventative against disease, the potions or poultices will also halt the advancement of lycanthropy provided the bite is less than a day old. You can craft two doses of antitoxin per hour spent. Items crafted with this feature will maintain their potency without spoiling for 1d4 days. Use of this feature requires an herbalism kit.

### Stalker’s Dodge
At 17th level, whenever a creature attacks you and does not have advantage, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the creature’s attack roll against you. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

### Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

## Pathfinder Archetypes

### Bounty Hunter

#### Tracker’s Expertise
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Investigation and Insight if you don’t already have it. Additionally, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for any checks involving stealth or sleight of hand when tracking or capturing a target.

#### Marked Prey
At 3rd level, you learn to mark your prey for swift and precise pursuit. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to mark them as your prey. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track that creature, and you deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier against that creature.

You gain proficiency with a new set of tools related to your bounty hunting methods, such as traps, manacles, or interrogation tools. You also gain advantage on attack rolls against creatures you have marked as your prey.

#### Master Tracker

You have advantage on all Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your marked prey.
You can’t be surprised by your marked prey, and they can’t escape your notice unless they successfully hide from you.
Your marked prey can’t benefit from invisibility or being heavily obscured to hide from you.
You have advantage on all attack rolls against your marked prey.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadow

#### Sharpshooter's Focus
You may spend your bonus action to aim your ranged weapon, gaining advantage on your next ranged attack roll.  This ability can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.  This ability recharges on a short rest.

#### Ambush Hunter
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to strike with deadly precision from the shadows. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack from hiding or while unseen by your target, you deal 2d6 extra damage. This extra damage increases to 3d8 at 11th level and 4d10 at 17th level.

#### Camouflage Expertise
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to camouflage yourself in natural surroundings. While camouflaged, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot creatures. You can remain camouflaged in this way for up to 1 hour, or until you move or take an action other than maintaining your camouflage.

#### Sniper's Precision
At 11th level, you gain the ability to target weak spots with incredible accuracy. When you make a weapon attack with a longbow or sniper rifle against a creature, you can choose to make a called shot. If the attack hits, you deal extra damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus Wisdom modifier, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

#### Vanishing Act
Starting at 15th level, you can disappear from sight in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
