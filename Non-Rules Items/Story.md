# Novemgrod, Setting the Stage

The Mist Cliffs of Novemgrod stand as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its inhabitants. Situated on the western edge of the Eastern Shelf, this once-thriving city found itself on the precipice of oblivion when the Murk engulfed its surroundings, leaving only two sides exposed to the enigmatic mist. In the wake of such a devastating catastrophe, the survival of Novemgrod hinged upon the unwavering dedication of the builder's guilds.

Faced with the imminent threat of dissolution, the skilled craftsmen and women of Novemgrod's builder's guilds rallied together, laboring tirelessly for weeks on end. Their collective efforts were focused on salvaging what remained of the city, fortifying its structures, and shoring up the foundations against the encroaching mist. It was through their unwavering determination and unwavering spirit that Novemgrod managed to withstand the relentless onslaught of the Murk, emerging as a beacon of hope amidst the chaos.

While the city may have lost many of its historical quarters to the relentless advance of the mist, fragments of its glorious past still linger. Among the remnants, the legendary Palatine Regium, an ancient stronghold and castle dating back to the bygone era of the Imperium, stands as a proud testament to Novemgrod's storied history. This architectural marvel, though weathered by time and the encroaching mist, stands as a poignant symbol of the city's enduring spirit.

The transformation brought about by the Murktide has given rise to a unique and awe-inspiring architectural landscape within Novemgrod. The clash between the absurdist architecture, born out of necessity and the urgency of rebuilding, and the few remaining ancient spires creates a surreal juxtaposition. The cityscape becomes a tapestry of grandiose impressions and resolute desperation, where the ingenuity of the builders merges with the echoes of a glorious past.

The shifting nature of the Murktide imposes a constant challenge upon the inhabitants of Novemgrod. As the mist ebbs and flows, several teams of dedicated workers swiftly move to fortify and reinforce the foundations of the western plazas. Their tireless efforts, undertaken with a sense of urgency and purpose, are essential in safeguarding the city against the relentless onslaught of the encroaching mist. With each shift of the Murktide, the fate of Novemgrod hangs in the balance, and the resilience of its people is put to the test.

In the face of adversity, Novemgrod stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the unwavering determination to forge a future amidst the encroaching darkness. The Mist Cliffs, with their mixture of survivalist architecture and ancient remnants, serve as a haunting reminder of the fragility of existence and the relentless march of time. Yet, within the mist-shrouded city, a glimmer of hope persists, as the people of Novemgrod continue to defy the odds and write their own tale of resilience and survival in the shadow of the Murk.

## Nobles, Bereft of Nobility

Destined to be an unlikely ruler, Ruvan's path to becoming the Grand Prince was fraught with challenges and disapproval. His own uncle, Milov, held disdain for him throughout his life, belittling him with harsh words of being too soft and ignorant of the world. These disparaging remarks echoed in Ruvan's ears during his formative years, a constant reminder of his perceived inadequacies.

The shadow of comparison loomed over Ruvan, particularly in relation to his cousin Rikov, a valiant prince known for his prowess in battle. Rikov, two years Ruvan's senior, possessed the qualities of bravery and physical prowess that were esteemed in their society. While the two shared a genuine friendship outside the confines of court, Rikov never truly grasped the depths of Ruvan's bookish and delicate nature. As fate would have it, Ruvan's path seemed destined for a life of administration, a role befitting his scholarly inclinations.

However, the onset of The War changed everything. Milov and Rikov departed Novemgrod, leaving Ruvan to govern in their absence as they rallied their armies and Magisters to confront the impending threat from the West. Tragically, they never returned, leaving Ruvan to inherit a shattered homeland and the weighty responsibility of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic family.

Despite his youth, Ruvan proved to be a wise and discerning ruler. Surrounded by knowledgeable advisors, he exhibited a disregard for the corrupt machinations of the Councils, instead prioritizing the welfare of his subjects. In essence, he embodied the ideals of an enlightened despot, although at times, his determination and inclination towards micromanagement led him down a path of stubbornness. Trusting only a select few among his fellow nobles, Ruvan maintained a cautious proximity to them, aware that a palace coup could be brewing at any moment. While he appeared physically frail, his gaze betrayed a profound insight that seemed to transcend the mortal realm.

In times of need, Ruvan sought the counsel of High Magister Valeska, a relationship built on politeness and friendship. Their interactions served a mutual purpose: the Magister relied on Ruvan for survival, while he sought her guidance in matters of esoteric knowledge. Perhaps something deeper existed between them, a connection that surpassed their respective stations, but the constraints of their roles prevented any further union. Nonetheless, they conversed as kindred spirits, individuals left behind by their more formidable and foolish predecessors, navigating a world that demanded their wisdom and resilience.

## The Cries of Salvation

The echoes of diverse faiths resound through the bustling streets of Novemgrod, a metropolitan center within a larger cosmopolitan region. Within this vibrant tapestry of beliefs, different religions coexist and collaborate while simultaneously engaging in a constant competition for the souls of the populace. It is important to note that these overlapping faiths do not necessarily exclude one another, and grand acts of charity, benevolence, and even "miracles" performed by rival clergy are not uncommon occurrences, each seeking to capture the attention and devotion of the masses.

Generally speaking, the interfaith rivalry remains peaceful, though not always entirely fair. Instances where a miracle is thwarted by a servant of a competing faith may elicit indignation and scorn, yet rarely does this verbal conflict escalate into physical violence. However, an exception to this norm exists in the form of secretive cults that emerge to worship and draw power from the enigmatic Murk and its enigmatic inhabitants. Whispers of nocturnal rituals at the edge of the city persist, though the identities of those involved are veiled in mystery. Furthermore, certain gods are deemed unwelcome in the light of day, such as the ominous Charred One and the enigmatic Apatur. Despite lacking an overt following on paper, intrigue and suffering continue to afflict the city, leaving a lingering sense of unease.

With the exception of the aforementioned cases, the majority of faiths denounce The Murk and its creators, the Magisters. Prior to The War, religious leaders perceived themselves as the sole guardians against the growing power of the Magisters and their imposing Spires. They criticized those who dabbled in Esoteria, viewing their practices as audacious attempts to breach the divine realm and attain godhood themselves.

The calamitous downfall of the Magisters and the subsequent Cataclysm only served to validate the concerns of the faiths. As a result, anyone practicing Esoteria is often met with censure within religious circles, if not outright excommunication, rendering them social outcasts. It is only due to the Magisters' indispensable role in maintaining the vast sea of mist that envelops the city that they have been spared from the torches of religious fervor thus far, for their continued involvement remains a necessity, albeit a begrudging one.

## Towers and Magisters

Perched upon the smoldering remnants of a city she once cherished in her youth, High Magister Valeska II finds herself entangled in a web of complex emotions and daunting responsibilities. Born into poverty as the daughter of a humble practitioner of rudimentary Esoteria, Valeska embarked on a relentless ascent through the ranks of the Magisterial order, fueled by her unwavering determination and meticulous approach.

Despite achieving the esteemed status of Magister and unlocking the coveted Sixth Seal, Valeska encountered an insurmountable barrier that prevented her from ascending to the ranks of the nobility. The entrenched power of the old bloodlines that permeated the spires conspired against this newcomer, obstructing any path to upward mobility for the Novus Homo. However, fate intervened, and three fortuitous circumstances saved Valeska from a life of mediocrity.

Firstly, her exceptional aptitude for Esoteria set her apart as one of the most gifted practitioners of her generation, affording her unparalleled access to the arcane arts. This remarkable talent, combined with her sharp political acumen, caught the attention of Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod.

Recognizing her unique blend of cunning and raw power, Milov interceded on her behalf, beseeching the Council to grant her opportunities commensurate with her abilities. Moreover, it was the Council's prejudiced rejection and disdain for the "outsider" that inadvertently spared Valeska's life.

Elevated to a position within the Council, Valeska found herself unwittingly excluded from their grand plan to secure victory in The War. She wept bitter tears upon realizing she would not share in the glory of their triumph. However, the tides of fortune shifted abruptly with The Calamity, turning her perceived loss into both a hollow victory and an inescapable burden.

As the blame for the catastrophe fell squarely upon the shoulders of the Council, the populace directed their ire towards Valeska, the now High Magister. Were it not for the intervention of Prince Ruvan, she would have likely faced condemnation and punishment, consigned to the unforgiving depths of The Murk as retribution for the council's egregious hubris.

Now, Valeska presides over a decaying system, perched atop a fragile throne of authority. Her loyal Magisters toil tirelessly, their efforts dedicated to upholding the weakening wards and safeguarding the remnants of the city and its beleaguered inhabitants. Yet, concealed both within the city's boundaries and amidst the alabaster walls of The Spire, clandestine movements fester, plotting to enact a radical transformation of the prevailing regime. The burden resting upon Valeska's shoulders is immeasurable, for all bear witness to the Council's role in precipitating the great Calamity, and no act can absolve them of their collective guilt.

## Woe of the Commons

The soldier, the farmer, and the factory worker—these stalwart individuals have weathered the trials and tribulations of the past three decades with a resilient determination. Their unwavering resolve to forge a better life for themselves and their loved ones has been met with relentless obstacles imposed by higher powers. In the eyes of princes and high priests, the lives of ten common people hold little significance when weighed against the grand struggles of nations and souls. What price must be paid for the happiness of orphans and the destitute amidst the machinations of power?

Nevertheless, they persist, day in and day out, toiling ceaselessly, brick by brick, as the unsung architects of a new world. It is they who bear the burden of rebuilding, even when their efforts are exploited by their superiors, for whom their plight often goes unnoticed. Blinded by their entourage of counselors, princes fail to perceive the struggles of the common folk. While the churches offer assistance, they exact a spiritual toll, demanding adherence to rituals and beliefs. In the aftermath of the war, many have lost faith, although their deep-seated superstitions remain entrenched. The mention of Esoteria—the forbidden realm of forbidden knowledge—is deemed taboo at most dinner tables, alongside the contentious topic of politics. Both subjects have claimed the lives of their sons, brothers, and fathers, and the resentments borne from these losses shall remain until death claims them.

Yet amidst their collective hardships, a flickering ember of hope endures within their hearts. They cherish the noble aspirations that reside within them, safeguarding their dreams even as they harbor skepticism. Their spirits may be wounded, but the indomitable spirit of resilience remains, a testament to their unwavering determination to preserve their dignity and seek justice. For within the unyielding resolve of these unsung heroes lies the potential for change, a silent rebellion against the forces that have sought to subjugate them. Though their voices may not always be heard, their silent struggle continues, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

## Rising Opportunists

Driven to the brink by the absence of legal avenues for survival and upward mobility, a significant portion of the lower classes finds solace in the embrace of criminality. Organized crime syndicates and gangs weave their intricate webs of influence, entrenching themselves within the fabric of almost every neighborhood in the sprawling expanse of major cities. Astonishingly, a few of these criminal entities have even been granted official recognition by the ruling elite, trading the semblance of legitimacy in exchange for maintaining a semblance of order within the city's confines.

Simultaneously, another contingent of society seeks refuge in the realm of Freelancery, gravitating towards the ranks of mercenary companies or even forming their own. Comprising veterans of The War, these groups are veiled in the guise of professional soldiers but often bear an uncanny resemblance to hired brigands. When challenges emerge that cannot be openly addressed by the Princes or their courtiers, they reluctantly turn to these costly yet expendable factions, entrusting them with the delicate task of resolving matters discreetly, away from the prying eyes of the public.

The rise of these alternative paths is a testament to the fraying social fabric and the erosion of trust in traditional systems of governance. Faced with limited opportunities for legal advancement or fair treatment, individuals from the lower echelons of society have been compelled to venture into the shadowy realms of organized crime or embrace the precarious life of a hired sword. Their choices reflect a profound disillusionment with the prevailing social order, where the rule of law fails to provide equitable opportunities and those in power turn a blind eye to the struggles of the marginalized. It is a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities that continue to plague the realm, pushing its inhabitants to seek unconventional means of survival and justice in a world that has failed them.

## What Lies Ahead?

The future of Novemgrod hangs precariously in the balance, as uncertainty shrouds the city in an aura of mystery and apprehension. Whispers of clandestine cults, their dark rituals concealed in the cloak of night, permeate the outskirts, adding an air of eerie intrigue to the already tumultuous atmosphere. Meanwhile, the diligent delvers, braving the treacherous remnants of the fallen city, unearth cryptic artifacts and relics that hint at forgotten secrets and hidden truths.

Both the Prince and the High Magister, the pillars of authority in Novemgrod, cling to power with a tenuous grip, unaware of the fragility of their positions. Their threads of control are worn thin, susceptible to unforeseen forces that lurk in the shadows, poised to unravel the very fabric of their rule. The Prince, burdened with the weight of his family's heroic legacy, faces the constant struggle to assert his authority and navigate the intricate webs of court intrigue. Meanwhile, the High Magister, Valeska, finds herself in a position of immense responsibility, burdened not only by the crumbling remnants of a broken system but also by the knowledge of the Council's complicity in the calamity that befell the city.

In this climate of uncertainty and vulnerability, the destiny of Novemgrod hangs in the balance. Will the secrets whispered in the dark bring about salvation or damnation? Can the delvers' discoveries hold the key to uncovering the city's hidden past and shaping its future? As the Prince and the High Magister teeter on the edge of their authority, unaware of the forces conspiring against them, the threads that bind Novemgrod's fate together grow ever thinner. The outcome of these tangled events remains elusive, leaving the city and its inhabitants teetering on the precipice of a destiny yet to be revealed.
