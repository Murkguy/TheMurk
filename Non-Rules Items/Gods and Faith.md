- Death is not to be feared but embraced; it is a gift granted to the weak, an escape from the dying world.

- Destruction holds an inherent beauty, an exquisite form of expression.

\*\*Holy Days

- The Red Day - May 6th: Commemorating the anniversary of the devastating Gavo firestorm and the birth of their god.

- Herald's Day - August 31st: Observing the anniversary of The Black Day, a significant event in their history.

- The period between The Red Day and Herald's Day is known as Brenndauer, a time when the followers of the Charred One are called to be most active, stoking the flames of their mad pursuit.

No grand temples stand in honor of the Charred One, nor do intentional monuments proclaim their existence. Their monuments are the scorched remnants of cities, and their temples lie within the ruins left by others. In the aftermath of the Great War, those who survived faced a choice: to rebuild or to revel in the ashes of what once stood.

The birth of the Charred One came from the desolation of Gavo, a city ravaged by a cataclysmic firestorm in the year 3 BBD. It emerged silently, calling out to those filled with grief, trauma, and madness.

Followers of the Charred One encounter no tolerance for their beliefs within established cities or towns. Instead, they gather in abandoned places, congregating in the shadows before spreading to the farthest reaches of Tellus to fulfill the will of their deranged deity.

The Charred believe in the ultimate unmaking of all creation, and they employ any means necessary to bring about its destruction. Through manipulation, intrigue, assassination, and incitement of unrest, they seek to ignite the world in chaos. They take particular pleasure in obliterating ancient structures and monuments, for in their destruction, not only the present is ruined but also all potential futures are erased.

### The Burning Congregation

Followers of the Charred One operate in a clandestine and covert manner, reminiscent of terroristic cells or cults. They are driven by their dark devotion to destruction, chaos, and the ultimate annihilation of all creation. Their actions are marked by ruthlessness, secrecy, and a willingness to employ any means necessary to further their cause.

Acting as agents of terror, the followers of the Charred One execute acts of violence, sabotage, and manipulation to sow fear and chaos within society. They target symbols of stability, authority, and ancient structures, relishing in the destruction that erases not only the present but also all potential futures. Their acts range from arson and assassination to incitement of unrest and manipulation of power dynamics.

Recruitment of new members is a delicate and secretive process. The followers of the Charred One seek out individuals who exhibit signs of grief, trauma, and madness, drawing them towards the allure of the destructive deity. They identify those disillusioned with the established order, seeking purpose and an outlet for their deep-seated pain. Through subtle manipulation, the followers gradually expose these individuals to the ideologies and rituals of the Charred One, enticing them with promises of power, release from fear, and the ecstasy of destruction.

Recruitment efforts primarily occur in abandoned places and hidden gatherings, away from the prying eyes of society. Potential recruits are approached individually, tested for their resilience, and gradually introduced to the twisted beliefs and practices of the cult. The followers of the Charred One exploit their vulnerabilities, amplifying their fears and anguishes, ultimately offering them a sense of purpose and belonging within the cult's dark embrace.

The recruitment process involves indoctrination through rituals, rites, and teachings that reinforce the notions of destruction, chaos, and the beauty found in annihilation. New members are gradually initiated into the cult's inner circle, where they are assigned mentors to guide them in the dark arts, imparting knowledge of fire manipulation, subterfuge, and the secrets of the Charred One's doctrines.

Trust and loyalty are paramount among the followers, as betrayal is met with severe consequences. The cult operates with strict secrecy, ensuring that their activities remain hidden from the eyes of authority. Members communicate through encrypted channels and secret symbols, using coded language to avoid detection. This secretive nature ensures that the followers remain elusive, striking fear into the hearts of those who would stand against them.

### Ranks of The Charred

They are responsible for organizing and leading small cells of followers, executing acts of destruction, and spreading fear and chaos in the name of the Charred One.

**Ashmancers:**

They serve as the muscle and enforcers within the cells, ensuring obedience and punishing any signs of wavering loyalty.

**Flamebound:**
The Flamebound are the lowest ranks of the Charred One's followers. They have recently joined the cult and have yet to undergo significant transformations. However, their devotion to the Charred One is unquestionable, and they strive to prove their loyalty and ascend the ranks. Flamebound are tasked with gathering information, reconnaissance, and recruitment of potential followers. They are the entry point into the cult-like cells and are closely monitored by higher-ranking members.

### Sins

**Betrayal of Secrets:** Revealing the hidden rituals, doctrines, or identities of fellow cult members or the inner workings of the Charred One's operations to outsiders is considered a grave transgression. It undermines the cult's secrecy and puts its members at risk.

**Failure to Execute Destructive Acts:** Followers of the Charred One are expected to actively contribute to the cause of destruction and chaos. Failing to carry out assigned acts of violence, sabotage, or manipulation is seen as a betrayal of their commitment to the deity and his teachings.

Any expression of sentiment or reluctance towards embracing the annihilation and eradication advocated by the Charred One is seen as a serious transgression.

The followers of the Charred One operate with a strict chain of command, and any act of disobedience disrupts the unity and effectiveness of their destructive efforts.

**Collaboration with Opposing Forces:** Engaging in alliances, collaborations, or cooperations with individuals or groups that are actively opposing or obstructing the goals of the Charred One is seen as a betrayal. The cult expects absolute loyalty and allegiance to its cause, leaving no room for compromise or cooperation with those who stand against them.

**Doubt or Questioning:** Expressing doubt or questioning the teachings, ideologies, or actions of the Charred One is viewed as a transgression against the cult's core beliefs. Followers are expected to have unwavering faith and conviction in the path of destruction and chaos set forth by their deity.

**Failure to Initiate New Recruits:** Each member of the cult is entrusted with the task of recruiting and expanding their ranks. Failing to actively seek out and initiate new followers is considered a transgression. It hinders the growth and influence of the cult, impeding its ability to further the cause of destruction and spread chaos.

**Revealing Personal Weaknesses:** Sharing personal vulnerabilities or weaknesses with outsiders or fellow cult members is seen as a transgression against the cult's ethos. Followers are expected to present a unified front, projecting strength, and embracing the power that comes from the destruction they seek.

### Atonement

Atonement for transgressions within the cult of the Charred One is a complex and arduous process, as the deity and his followers embrace destruction and chaos rather than traditional notions of repentance. However, there are some ways in which a follower can seek to regain favor and mitigate the consequences of their transgressions:

**Offering Greater Destruction:** One way to atone is to demonstrate an intensified commitment to the cause of destruction and chaos. The follower must engage in acts of unparalleled devastation, surpassing their previous actions and proving their dedication to the Charred One's principles. By causing widespread mayhem and furthering the cult's goals, they can strive to redeem themselves.

**Sacrificial Rituals:** Followers can partake in sacrificial rituals where they offer something significant to appease the Charred One and seek forgiveness. This might involve sacrificing a cherished possession, enduring physical pain, or even offering the lives of others to demonstrate their devotion and willingness to make amends.

**Undertaking a Trial by Fire:** A follower seeking atonement may undergo a trial by fire, a grueling test of their loyalty and commitment. This could involve enduring physical or psychological challenges, walking through flames, or subjecting themselves to extreme environments or situations associated with fire and destruction. Success in the trial signifies purification and potential forgiveness.

**Completing a Mission of Destruction:** The follower can be assigned a specific mission or task by the cult's leadership, designed to showcase their renewed dedication and loyalty. By successfully executing this mission, causing significant destruction or sowing chaos, they can demonstrate their remorse and willingness to make amends for their transgressions.

**Reaffirming Allegiance through Rituals:** Participating in intense and elaborate rituals can serve as acts of atonement. These rituals may involve self-flagellation, enduring pain or hardship, or engaging in acts symbolizing destruction and rebirth. Through these rituals, the follower reinforces their commitment to the Charred One and seeks purification from their past failures.

It's important to note that forgiveness within the cult of the Charred One is not easily granted. Atonement is a demanding and ongoing process that requires extreme dedication, unwavering loyalty, and a continuous pursuit of destruction. Even if a follower manages to atone for their transgressions, the memory of their past actions may linger, and they may always be viewed with caution and scrutiny by their fellow cult members.

## The Tursakkaanen

**Creeds**

- The world is indifferent, neither cruel nor wonderful. It simply exists, as do we.

- As humans, we are beings designed to experience. We are rewarded with pleasure and punished with pain.

- The wind carries no bias; it is driven by the currents of the world.

**Holy Days**

- Red Sunsets: A sacred phenomenon for the Listeners, during which they may hear the whispers of their gods.

- Long Twilight - December: In the Northern regions, this time of year is enveloped in near-constant darkness. It becomes an opportunity for the holy men to ascend the Mountain and attain new wisdom while their gods awaken.

Far to the North, the Tursakkaanen observe the world from their perch atop Mount Avrenthorn. They uphold an ancient system of laws and rituals passed down by the shamans and holy seers of the icy steppe.

While they do not actively interfere in the affairs of mankind, they exert influence upon those who are willing to listen to their timeless wisdom. Pilgrims who embark upon the arduous journey to the summit of the towering mountains may experience the resounding voices of the Nine echoing within their minds. The words are spoken slowly, spanning years to complete.

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, choose to surrender themselves to the currents of fate and the guidance of their own thoughts. They extend their consciousness beyond the present moment, immersing themselves in the ancient chants and sacred utterances of their deities. This communion allows them to become vessels of fate. A Listener often finds themselves in precisely the right place at the right time, although they may endure suffering as a consequence of their serendipity.

The Listeners are generally welcomed but met with some distrust among people from various corners of the world. Their tendency to also embody the roles of vagabonds, thieves, or humble individuals relegates them to the lower echelons of society within urban areas.

### The Listeners

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, operate with a sense of purpose and devotion deeply rooted in their guiding principles. They perceive the world as an indifferent entity and believe in surrendering themselves to the currents of fate. The Listeners act with a certain level of detachment, recognizing that pleasure and pain are inherent aspects of human existence.

The Listeners lead a nomadic lifestyle, wandering through various lands and rarely gathering outside of Suomi Lands. They can often be seen working closely with tribal leaders in the northern regions, forging alliances and offering their unique insights. However, in other parts of the world, the Listeners may appear as vagabonds, blending into the lower echelons of society.

Recruitment of new members into the Tursakkaanen is an organic process driven by personal experiences and revelations. Potential recruits are often individuals who have shown a proclivity for seeking deeper truths and contemplating the workings of the world. They may encounter Listeners during their own journeys or chance encounters, where the Listeners share their timeless wisdom and insights. Those who resonate with the philosophy and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen may choose to join their ranks voluntarily.

The Listeners value introspection and self-discovery, encouraging new members to embark on personal quests and pilgrimages to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They believe in the power of experience and direct revelation, as well as the resounding voices of the Nine that echo within the minds of the faithful. Listeners may guide and mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of their newfound spiritual path.

The Listeners prioritize the preservation of their ancient laws, rituals, and wisdom. They rely on oral traditions and sacred chants passed down through generations, keeping their beliefs alive through the recitation of ancient texts and the performance of rituals. Listeners engage in deep communion with their deities, seeking guidance and enlightenment from the voices that resonate within them.

Overall, the Listeners operate with a sense of humility, embracing their role as vessels of fate. They strive to live in harmony with the world and its natural rhythms, while offering their wisdom and guidance to those who are open to receiving it. The actions of the Listeners are guided by their unique understanding of the interconnectedness of fate, power, cold, life, and death, and their desire to navigate the currents of existence with grace and insight.

### The 5 Ranks of Nine

**Elder Seers:** The Elder Seers are the highest-ranking individuals within the Tursakkaanen hierarchy. They are the most experienced and wise Listeners who have spent a lifetime communing with the Nine and receiving their timeless wisdom. Elder Seers are revered as the ultimate authorities and spiritual leaders among the Listeners.

**Tribal Liaisons:** These are Listeners who have earned the trust and respect of the tribal leaders in the northern regions where the Tursakkaanen frequently operate. They act as intermediaries between the Listeners and the tribal communities, facilitating cooperation and mutual understanding. Tribal Liaisons often possess deep knowledge of tribal customs, rituals, and traditions, serving as a bridge between the Tursakkaanen and the indigenous people.

**Sacred Scribes:** The Sacred Scribes are skilled individuals among the Listeners who possess the ability to transcribe and interpret the sacred chants, rituals, and prophecies of the Tursakkaanen. They meticulously record the ancient wisdom bestowed upon them by the Nine and ensure the preservation of their sacred texts. Sacred Scribes play a crucial role in maintaining the collective knowledge and spiritual traditions of the Listeners.

**Ritual Guardians:** Ritual Guardians are entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the sacred rituals, artifacts, and places of worship of the Tursakkaanen. They are skilled in the intricacies of the ritualistic practices and act as protectors of the Listeners' spiritual heritage. Ritual Guardians are also responsible for conducting ceremonies, guiding the faithful, and maintaining the sanctity of the sacred sites.

**Seekers of Fate:** Seekers of Fate are Listeners who have embarked on a personal journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. They undertake arduous quests and pilgrimages to distant lands, seeking to expand their understanding of the world and strengthen their connection with the Nine. Seekers of Fate often bear distinctive ritualistic tattoos, each with a unique name symbolizing their personal quest or revelation. These tattoos serve as marks of distinction and recognition within the hierarchy.

It is worth noting that the hierarchy within the Tursakkaanen is fluid and flexible due to their wandering nature and decentralized structure. Authority and influence are often earned through wisdom, experience, and the respect garnered from both the Listeners themselves and the tribal communities with whom they interact. The ritualistic tattoos carried by the Seekers of Fate serve as visual indicators of their station and accomplishments within the hierarchy, symbolizing their spiritual growth and journey toward enlightenment.

**Disrupting Sacred Ceremonies or Rituals:** The Tursakkaanen hold their ceremonies and rituals as sacred and integral to their faith. A follower who intentionally disrupts or disrespects these ceremonies, whether through interruption, mockery, or inappropriate behavior, commits a transgression that dishonors the traditions and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen.

**Failing to Uphold the Values of Serenity and Detachment:** The Tursakkaanen believe in embracing the world with serenity and accepting the currents of fate. A follower who consistently acts with anger, aggression, or seeks personal gain at the expense of others violates the values of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression against the peaceful and detached nature they strive to embody.

It is important to note that the Tursakkaanen view transgressions as opportunities for growth and redemption. They believe in the power of self-reflection, repentance, and seeking forgiveness from the Nine and the community of Listeners. A follower who recognizes their transgressions, seeks atonement, and actively works towards rectifying their actions can find a path to redemption within the faith of the Tursakkaanen.
