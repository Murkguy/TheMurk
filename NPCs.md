## Notable Faces

### Prince Ruvan

Prince Ruvan, a figure marked by both resilience and vulnerability, carries a backstory that weaves together strands of longing, determination, and unexpected grace. Born into the noble lineage of Novemgrod, Ruvan's path to power was riddled with challenges and insecurities. His early years were shadowed by the disapproval of his uncle, Milov, who dismissed him as "soft" and lacking worldly knowledge. This constant comparison to his brave and esteemed cousin, Rikov, only deepened Ruvan's feelings of inadequacy.

Physically, Ruvan stands at an average height, his frame stocky and strong from soldiering these last decades. His fair complexion bears the faint remnants of childhood illnesses and adult hardships, which left him marked and scarred in appearance. Yet behind his seemingly frail exterior lies a gaze that reveals an otherworldly insight, hinting at a depth of wisdom and resilience that surpasses his 40 years.

Despite his physical limitations, Ruvan possesses an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a penchant for intellectual pursuits. While his cousin Rikov thrived in the realm of battle, Ruvan found solace within the pages of philosophy and fiction. He immersed himself in the works of great thinkers, seeking refuge in the realms of imagination and introspection.

When The War erupted, fate thrust Ruvan into an unforeseen role. Milov and Rikov, the pillars of his family, entrusted him with the responsibility of leading Novemgrod while they amassed their armies. However, their absence would become permanent, leaving Ruvan to inherit the shattered remains of his home and the daunting task of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic lineage.

In the face of adversity, Ruvan proved himself a wise and compassionate ruler. He surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors, valuing their counsel over the corrupt machinations of the Councils. Despite his youthful appearance, Ruvan exhibited a tenacious resolve, venturing into the realm of micromanagement to ensure the well-being of his subjects.

To seek guidance in matters of esoteric nature, Ruvan often sought the company of High Magister Valeska. Their meetings were characterized by a polite and amicable demeanor, borne out of the mutual understanding that their fates were intertwined. The unspoken connection between them, though stifled by their respective stations, hinted at a shared sense of being abandoned by their predecessors and a shared longing for redemption.

Amidst the turmoil that plagues Novemgrod, Ruvan remains a beacon of hope and resilience for his people. His frailty belies a profound strength of character, and his unwavering determination to navigate the treacherous currents of power and rebuild a shattered world fuels the whispers of a brighter future in the hearts of his subjects.

### The High Magister Valeska

High Magister Valeska, a figure shrouded in enigma and tempered by adversity, bears a backstory that intertwines elements of resilience, ambition, and a deep connection to the arcane arts. From humble beginnings, Valeska's journey into the realm of magic was both an escape and a means to transcend her circumstances.

Born into a modest family in the outskirts of Novemgrod, Valeska's early years were marked by poverty and struggle. Her father, a rudimentary Esoterist, instilled in her a fascination with the mystical and the arcane. It was through her father's guidance and her own innate talent that she discovered her affinity for manipulating the forces of Esoteria.

Valeska's appearance is striking and beguiling, with flowing raven-black hair that cascades down her back like a midnight waterfall. Her piercing, almond-shaped eyes possess an ethereal quality, their vibrant blue hue often shimmering with a hint of secrets and hidden knowledge. Adorned in flowing robes of deep indigo, she carries an aura of both authority and mystery, her presence commanding attention and respect.

In her pursuit of arcane mastery, Valeska dedicated countless hours to honing her skills and unraveling the complexities of Esoteria. Her relentless determination and thirst for knowledge led her to ascend the ranks of the Magisterial order, even in the face of prejudice and opposition from the old bloods that clung to the traditional hierarchy.

However, her ascent was not without its share of sacrifices. As Valeska unlocked the Sixth Seal, a potent symbol of her mastery over Esoteria, she found herself barred from attaining nobility, a privilege reserved for those born into the old bloodlines. This injustice fueled her ambition, driving her to prove herself worthy of recognition and respect.

It was Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod who recognized Valeska's political acumen and unparalleled magical prowess. He saw in her the ideal combination of cunning and raw power required to navigate the treacherous corridors of power. Impressed by her abilities, he implored the Council to grant her a seat, elevating her to the esteemed position of High Magister.

As High Magister, Valeska stands at the precipice of a creaking and failing system, shouldering the weight of both responsibility and blame. Her days are filled with tireless efforts to keep the wards intact, preserving what remains of the city and its inhabitants. Many within and outside the alabaster walls of The Spire, disillusioned by the actions of the Council and the Spire itself, secretly conspire for regime change, placing Valeska in a precarious position where her every move is scrutinized.

In her private moments, Valeska often retreats to her study, surrounded by ancient tomes and arcane artifacts. There, she delves into the mysteries of forbidden knowledge, seeking insights and solutions to the challenges that beset Novemgrod. Her unwavering dedication to her craft is matched only by her desire to atone for the sins of the Council and find redemption for their hubris that led to The Calamity.

Haunted by the betrayal of her former allies, Valeska treads a delicate path, knowing that the trust of the populace hangs in the balance. She carries within her a burning desire to reshape the city, to forge a future where the mistakes of the past are not repeated, and where her mastery of Esoteria can be channeled toward the betterment of Novemgrod.

### Victor Volkov

Victor Volkov, widely known as "The Vors," is a formidable figure who holds significant influence over the city of Novemgrod. Born into the underbelly of the city, Victor's upbringing was marked by poverty and violence.

Known for his shrewd business acumen, Victor has managed to extend his influence beyond traditional criminal activities. Understanding the power dynamics of Novemgrod, he has taken control of the city's security, effectively becoming the manager of the royal guard. While The Stroidan, his loyal gang, engages in extortion and other illicit activities, Victor ensures that they maintain a delicate balance of power, preventing outright chaos and ensuring relative peace on the streets. Despite his criminal activities, he maintains a certain code of honor within his organization, punishing those who overstep boundaries and providing a sense of security for the citizens who would otherwise be left vulnerable.

Beyond his criminal empire, Victor possesses a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the city's power dynamics. He carefully navigates the complex political landscape, forging alliances and manipulating key players to further his own interests. While his actions may seem self-serving, Victor believes that he is the true guardian of Novemgrod, protecting it from internal and external threats in his own ruthless way.

However, despite his power and influence, Victor remains a mysterious and enigmatic figure. His true motivations and long-term goals are known only to a select few, and his actions often leave those around him questioning their loyalties. His ability to inspire fear and command respect has made him a figure of both admiration and trepidation, and many wonder if there is more to Victor Volkov than meets the eye.
